Hence original image will be retained until editors agree on a different image. Your snapshot you are forcing upon the page has nothing to offer, which you have proved by never be able to say anything positive about it. All you can do is throw trash on the original image to get your point across - aka strawman. And you continue doing so now by attempting attacks against me. Once again, that's all I could ask for. Thanks for proving me right on this one.",

Some people have an extremely hard time with WP:CON when it conflicts with their personal POV. They are the worst sort of editors. I'll take a simple vandal anytime over a soapboxer, POV pusher, a crufter, an agenda-ist or...ungh... worst of them all... inclusionists. Do you wanna know why 90% of Wiki articles suck? It's because 90% of its editors do too.  that's my mornings worth of philosophical wit shot to Hell in one morning... but it's goin' on my talk page D  Welcome to the 10% club my friend!",

I removed mention of this show from this article and Jerry Trainor's article. No mention was in the Mr. Lawrence article. I would like to see some proof of existence outside of web articles on Gillies and Trainor before considering this a valid credit for any person.",

Cutting and pasting the text of articles from one to another only moves the text; it does not move the edit history.  Fragmenting the edit history is both a nuisance and a legal issue, because when we don't provide a list of all contributors to an article, we are violating the GNU Free Documentation License.  For this reason, you should always use the built-in move feature.  If the location you wish to move to already exists, you will have to convince an administrator to do the move.\n\nBecause only administrators can undo a page move, please always make sure that other editors agree to your move before carrying it out.\n\nThanks for your contributions.   talk",

Psycho states that his favorite guitarists that influence his own style are Corey Beaulieu, Kirk Hammett, Dave Mustaine, Robb Flynn and Andy LaRocque. Also, he states that Robb Flynn, Matt Heafy and Phil Anselmo have influences his vocal style. Obie cites Oliver Palotai of Kamelot as a favorite keyboardist. As influences on his vocal style he mentions Brandon Boyd of Incubus and Roy Khan of Kamelot. Rob cites Robert Trujillo of Metallica as an influence and Cioky names John Dolmayan of SOAD as a favorite drummer. Sethgar has named Daron Malakian, also of SOAD as a favorite guitarist.\nThe band plays a blend of multiple genres of metal: metalcore, thrash metal, gothic metal, industrial metal and death metal, but they don't always put all the styles into a single song. They rather blend two or three of these styles into one song, making it difficult for their songs to be catalogued as a specific genre. \n\nBand members\n Psycho - Lead and Rythm guitars, growled vocals, rarely clean vocals \n Obie – Keyboards, clean vocals\n Sethgar – Acoustic Guitars\n Rob – Bass \n Cioky – Drums \n\nFormer members\n Stinkman - Bass \n Maq - Rythm guitar\n G-Orgy - Drums\n Legolas - Drums\n\nDiscography\n HORRORfying (2009 - single)\n Acheron (2009 - Not yet released)\n\n WIKIPEDIA SUCKS!!

The crime blog has be exposed many times as an ingenius idea.  It was started to showcase how many repeat violent offenders are given slaps on the wrist.   Very useful to someone wanting info about Charlotte\n\nThe realtor site is a company that has been featured on the news for helping fraud victims.   They were recognized by NC State represenative Deborah Ross.    Considering most real estate companies are crooks, its good to highlight one that is not.\n\nEverything that was there, expanded on important details not covered by the article.\n\nThat city-data forum is one of the best places to get accurate data from locals.  It's a very strict forum.. there are no advertisements.\n\nCarolina Nightlife is hands down the best Charlotte nightlife resource guide out there.  There is nothing relevant discussing anything about nightlife.  You can't expect to believe that your NARROW VIEW of what you believe is appropriate applies to everyone.  It doesn't!\n\nYou are a scumbag!   You ban me prematurely, and then tell me to discuss it.  How am I supposed to do that when I am banned??   I'm glad you clowns love the little power trip you get.   You don't know Charlotte, your selective enforcement policies are BULLSHIT, and you don't follow rules you are entrusted to enforce.",

There are lots of websites that capture photos of women just walking down the street, fully clothed in a bikini or shorts/shirt, and publish those photos online.  The problem here is NOT how the woman is dressed - the problem is the man holding the camera who drools at the mere sight of a woman (even one fully clothed).  Don't punish a woman for a cameraman's stupid actions.  -",
