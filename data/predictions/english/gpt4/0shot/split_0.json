        "Comment": "\"\n\n Ceiling fan article edit \n\nThanks for your recent contrib to the ceiling fan article. It's good when people edit things, because it sparks thought in new directions.\n\nI admire the originality of your thought, and the level of observance required to note such a detail as a fan's usefulness in humid versus dry climates.\n\nHoweverand I mean this in an amusing way, rather than offensivelyyou were totally wrong. The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards.\n\nThis is how the statement read before you edited it:\n\n\"\"Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments.\"\"\n\nYou said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads:\n\n\"\"The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air.\"\"\"\"\n\n...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful.\n\nI saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say \"\"Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!\"\". I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the \"\"bone-chilling\"\" factor into the mix.\n\nAnyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article. But thanks for reading it and contributing! In the future, before making edits to statements of fact in an already-established article, please get a consensus on the article's talk page.\n\nThanks!  \"",

What gives you the right to shit all over someone who has a hard life, who gets told he's a failure by his Father every single fucking day, who can't seem to please anyone in his friends and family?  What pleasure do you derive from your hatred of me? Do you want me to shed tears that I've been banned? Is that your sick game?  Because the fact of the matter is I'm simply going to take my own life because of you and I hope you're happy. I really truly hope you jump for joy because you made up the fact I wanted to disrupt this website. All I did was helpfully maintain Ring of Honor wrestler pages and you people simply treated me like shit for your own sick humor. This is why school shootings happen because innocent people like me are forced to eat shit sandwiches by people like you FisherQueen. You cause people not to want to live anymore and you are the disruptor. You're not God, you're just a human like me so fucking act like it.",

I'm not quite sure if there is any point replying at length, as you have obviously decided your opinion on how i stepped on the toes of the collaborative effort you hoped to achieve. I genuinely regret that, and acknowledge that my actions could be seen as offensive, but i know my intentions were good and I do not feel the need to apologise for proactively editing, encouraging other to do so also and doing my best to stick to Wikipedia policy. I really feel i can't win, however, as firstly i'm accused of ignoring fellow editors and forging my own path without acknowledging others, then when i work with Cesar and praise some of his edits, i'm accused of acting like \"\"a team leader encouraging the troops\"\" and not in a good way, i imagine. If proactivity and a policy of boldness is what offends you, then i believe you may have the problem, and not I.\n\nDespite the unfounded attack below - i'm still very keen to encourage your in put to this article, but i'd really rather not get into anymore finger pointing with you. You may have noticed the great strides the article has made in your absence over the last few days, mainly because we have been being bold and editing. If you are willing to join in, then please do so.  20:44\"",

You really are a hero, and I wish all of us could be a bit more like you! Continue this subconscious feeling of superiority to other people and eagarness to show off, it's great. You're abusive to everything that Scientology is about. It's about learning things for your own and adapting them into your own and using it as a tool for yourself, not becoming what you learn and getting further away from yourself, so you come off quite ridiculous without even realizing it. Oh yeah and all the lies about Scientology on wikipedia don't even really matter,if someone is going to get into Scientology, they're not going to be thrownoff by an encyclopedia that is known for being inaccurate because its written by anyone with a computer, and you take it so seriously like it's really going to affect things and this is  some warzone we need to fight, it's not going to stop scientology so don't worry about it",

May be some people of his skeptic team are real scientifics, they sure got graded from some college, but this \"\"debunker\"\" never went to any college ! so how can wikipedia call him a \"\"scientific\"\"? Do you know at least if he uses a scientific method for whatever he tries to debunk ?\nPeople, he didn't finished high school !!!\n\nURLTOK  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.224.230.5   \n\nYou can't even write proper English. What college did you go to?  What's up, Doc? \nThanks for the link, though. That's a great article on the amazing one.   \n\n I think scientific skepticism is related to following the scientific method, not formal education h2g2bob (talk) \nFor sure. The user 82.224.230.5 would likely know that. It's just trolling behavior.  What's up, Doc? \n\nI'm not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I'm talkng about)!\nOh, we know what you're talking about, all right. Trust me.   \nHis IP is French, so, yeah, I won't hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. \nBack on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that 'expert ~= god' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   \n\nSo according to you, it's enough to only \"\"suspect\"\" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!  I mean, is this the way wikipedia works ? you \"\"suspect\"\", how sure is that?! why didn't you even \"\"wonder\"\", that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career don't you think ?!\nI can't believe guys like you run wikipedia like kings of the info.. simply pitious.—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) \nI guess we should leave the 'no high-school' line in there.  It has nothing to do with 'scietific' vs 'non-scientific'.   His methods are unquestionably scientific, which of course explains why so few high profile psychics and fakers apply for the million dollar challenge.    \nI added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.   \n\n Works for me.  I'm guessing if he can teach college without a high-school degree, he could have attended college as well.  -)    \n\nThe IP again demonstrates that he's either a troll or an idiot, or both.  What's up, Doc? \"",

I will say this, it is obvious to me and to my advocate that though you assume what Willmcw says to be true, the edits I made were in fact worthy, and not only will your reply be redirected to my advocate but also to a host of otehr administrators. This has become such a trying time that I've been granted the ability to switch to a new identity and leave your vicious attacks behind. You have proven to be a slimy loose moralled child who spends too much time at wikipedia tryong to bully others out of the edits you have only taken up since this July. Whihc translates to the fac that your 'job' at 23 leaves you such an amount of free time that you can sling insults and barbs online rather than actually do positive work at Wikipedia. Whereas my edits may not have been as substantial as your own, my sockpuppetry related to willmcw, or at least buddying upo wiht him, has not been as pervasive as your own. I'm leaving. I'm fed up with the typical acne faced loser who can't get a date with a woman or a man, and so spends his time in front of his computer screen making alliances with other awkward socially malnourished dweebs who  can think of nothing better than to try an interact only thorugh the computer. You do a disservice to all computer geeks everywhere by trying to be more intelligent than others, because the lack of your vision seeps through the anger you display for all to see. Any true hacker knows that the way you have taking stands here has opened you up for retribution, as I am nnot a hacker, I won't work on such matters, in negative aspects. But you should be mindful that you've made a strong mess here, and no matter what your own opinon is, oyu should learn manners, and go out andd get a date rather than having your total amount of human interaction fed to you through wikipedia and your own websites.

Again, I realize the difference between a city, a metropolitan statistical area, a consolidated metropolitan statistical area, an area of urbanization, etc. My addition was in no way subjective or original research, but from U.S. Census Bureau statistics, and was intended to make the Jacksonville article consistent with Wikipedia articles covering nearly every other major U.S. city (i.e., putting the central city's surrounding metro into perspective in the opening without having to download an excel worksheet list in references). This information in no way detracts from this article and otherwise, the opening is simply a list of trivial details. At the very least, the opening paragraph of this article should state that the Jacksonville metro pop. (yes, METRO, not city) is ranked 42nd in the U.S. as of 2005, but adding that it is 4th in Florda does not hurt. I would add this accurate and scientific info myself, but I seem to be prevented from doing so, which I believe is totally against the spirit of Wikipedia.",

I'm trying not to get into a revert war over this, but it's really hard to take him seriously since he seems to cause a lot of other trouble.  If this keeps up, we might have to bring an administrator into this.  Let's both try and keep calm about this, though.   \n\nYeah, I'm not really sure what to do here, either.  It seems like we have consensus based on the responses, so I assume that would be grounds to going to an administrator, especially if all he does is revert.  (And, given his other edits, I don't think it would take long for the admins to make a call.)\n\nI still keep hoping that this will solve itself.  I emailed Billboard Research in early June about the goof, and received a response confirming that it was a mistake and that they'd pass on the info to \"\"the appropriate people\"\" (the web folks, I assume).  But I received the response on June 16th, and nothing's happened yet.   \"",

        "Comment": "==Those f**king horrible embedded ads== \n Straight from their forum messageboard: My major concern is the advertisements. Dear heavens. I will be watching a video, fullscreen and whatnot, been watching for 15 minutes, and then suddenly I hear a terribly loud advertisement just start playing. So I pause the video, minimize it, and look over to the right and see the ad window, screaming at me to buy this product. I then have to mute my computer because its one of those ads that don't have any sort of volume control or pause button. So I wait until its over and wait for the video after the ad to load and then pause it and continue my video. 15 minutes later, history repeats itself. Seriously, I'm not going to buy any Dove products for at least the next months out of sheer fury toward that event. I dunno if it's the people that own the ads or if it's you guys who maybe programmed something incorrectly, but it's just awful, and I would like to suggest that you maybe change that. \n Myself and the person above CANNOT be the only people having these problems with Veoh. Basically the sole administrator (yes, this site has just one, and he's a condescending asshole) says you have to go off-site and get download something to deal with it, rather than to simple change the way advertisments work on the site. The invasive ads deserve some kind of mention in the article. Period.",

I mention that now because I am interested to know about how citations like this one work.  The strengths and weaknesses or what is gained and what is lost.  There is a quote contained in the reference/citation style, but it can only be seen in edit mode (I think).  I am confused and I was unsuccessful when I attempted to reference that way.

        "Comment": "== Monday Records == \n\n Hi Nawlin. Please can you undo the delete of the page for Monday records, or advise me what I need to do to get this approved. Pikachunes (featured on wikipedia), is a serious upcoming NZ electronic music artist. Many external sources confirm Pikachunes as a notably significant act (which is why he is on Wikipedia I suppose). Monday records have recently signed Pikachunes, so I think that makes Monday Records notable by association. Regardless of the Pikachines connection, I also think that an independent record label signing exciting new acts such as this is very notable. I believe (as with most music artist enteries) it is entirley appropriate to include a wiki page on this up coming independent record label, as they sign more and more culturally significant acts such as Pikachunes. Wikipedia is a common source of reference for the music industry, and it is very common place for relevant record labels to be featured along with artists. As well as links to the Monday Records site, I also linked to 3rd party music news blogs who announced the new signing, as they also felt it newsworthy and culturally significant. Please can you restore the article, or let me know what more I can do. Thank you for your time. All the best.",

See for example the Gil Student's page deletion proccess to view examples of extreme bias against him by some of the Chabad WikiPedians and their attempts to hide that bias by quoting the WikiPedia  rules. Or see the reverts of the Chabad page and the Rebbes page by various people and some of the things they posted on the corresponding talk pages to \"\"prove\"\" the \"\"anti-mashichist\"\" agenda or \"\"anti-mashichist\"\" \"\"domination\"\" of the \"\"official Chabad\"\"\n\"",

These leaders are so dangerus that nobody on Earth will take them and when Congress realizes that they are to be released in a neighborhood near you? Well, it's a crazy situation. Teh anti-Gitmo can say bullshit all day long, but it ends up whose going to take these gifted (extremely talented/not dumb) evil-doers to America. If congress terrorists them in America, and a skyscraper falls or chemical bombs enter a stadium of some kind. It's bad enough that they sneak in with the illegal immigrates? Don't we have like 40 million illegals in USA already complete with 12 sanctuary cities that alienate the ICE Police. The Democrats want them to kill Americans....more gloom and doom to speak of....democrats love that kind of stuff.  The same party that complains about energy expenses, but won't build nuclear power plants like the Chinese do? And the Chinese are left on the political scale too! 1.7 billion people cost big time power resources....whoops I did it again.",

Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)\n\n3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)\n\nOh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)\n\nJESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.\n\nTake a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?\n\nLook at this page  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  \"",

        "Comment": "\"\n\nIt all depends on what you call free energy and what you call suppression. IMHO there are so many different free energy machines it's just hilarious. Knowing that makes the reason for suppressing them down all to obvious. If some one is getting stalked then you just take their word for it.\n\nThe main criticism of the theory is that these devices are absent in the market because they do not and cannot work. \n\nHere the excuse to ignore it is the ignorance it self. The tool of suppression is the argument the devices don't exist, but this is also the excuse for never looking at them at the same time. We cant have it both ways? Either the machines don't work or the theory is wrong. We cant assume the machines must work because the theory has to be wrong just like we cant assume the theory must be right because the machines cant work. Most people will continue not believing it's real even after being confronted with such device. They will stand there screaming about the laws of thermodynamics. People like the inventors twin brother, or their wife. Not very likely to convince a wikipedian if you cant convince your wife now it is? The suppression is not so much executed by special interest groups as by the mainstream dogma. The dogma is however much supported by the special interests.\n\nSigns of real professional free energy suppression you can see here on wikipedia. Every actor in history is worthy of his own page but weird inventions not confirmed by mainstream science (working or not is irrelevant) apparently cant have a page here. The few free energy machines still having their own wikipedia page are full of rant how crackpots try to destroy the laws of thermodynamics and how nutterish they are, not your usual trolling but the work of experts. Take the introduction of the Water fuel cell. \"\"the source of this addition energy has not been scientifically identified therefore the theory is treated with skepticism.\"\" There was barely any theory, it just worked! And it has not been investigated. The way it's treated is not worthy of being in the description. An encyclopedia should not instruct it's readers behaviour? Tell me how to treat things huh? \"\"such a practice conforms to the parameters of perpetual motion, hence conclusive scientific investigation would either verify violation of thermodynamic law or identify the source of claimed additional energy.\"\" But if there isn't going to be any scientific analysis - ever! then the laws of thermodynamics are nonsense. If the best scientists can do is preach the laws then it's just not very likely they are right about the topic. Then it says: \"\"At least one car prototype, reportedly powered by a water fuel cell, has been assembled.\"\" HUH what? but but but?? You know what I mean? \"\"Meyer's claims about the Water Fuel Cell and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996.\"\" His wiki use to say \nURLTOK\n\"\"It failed to work during a required demonstration of the water-fueled car. An Ohio court found Stanley Meyer guilty of fraud in a case brought against him by disgruntled investors.\"\" So he was scammed by his own investors. What kind of person would do that with a known to work invention? And why was this important information deleted? Then it says: Stanley Meyer was granted patents in the United States and abroad starting in 1989. The verifiability, and scientific basis, of the patents are controversial. Now I know the water motor patents where granted after a working model was displayed. You can see it in the application number. There is no other way to get a patent on an electrolysis cell. Because of those laws of thermodynamics you know? You do know about those right? You can see free energy suppression live at work when you see that the world famous American inventor Stanley Meyer was not worthy of his own wikipedia page. It's obvious he cant have a page because that would violate conservation of energy right? Paul Pantone does have his own page where again the working of his device is denied by no-witness, The GEET page however describes a Hindi film? BTW Paul was also scammed by his investors? ha-ha? Yull Brown is also not worthy of his own page? Makes it kind of hard to write about free energy suppression when the suppressed and murdered inventors are not allowed the light of day? What about William A. Rhodes? Dennis klein then? no? Isaac de Rivaz? Daniel Dingle? etc etc?? At least we still have the Oxyhydrogen page right? haha? This is how free energy suppression is done. I would love to make a page for each one of them with most credible references but it's just not going to be allowed. The wall of propaganda is much to thick. I can think of better ways to kill myself. ha-ha ''here. I'll also take the opportunity to remind you that we a",

A recent series of short autobiographies seems interesting though I believe the Alun Watkins book was described as anodyne.\nIncidentally I believe a tension has grown up between Cricketarchive and the ACS.(Last AGM) Oh and I am not a member but know several very well.)",

But no such luck.\n\nI think you may be mistaken in your assertion that Clio and myslef have \"\"buried the hatchet\"\". I may have \"\"buried the hatchet\"\" with her through my unqualified, unconditional apology, only to get a lukewarm \"\"ok-I'll-accept-your-apology-but-you're-still-wrong-and-I'm-still-right-so-please-continue-to-stay-away-from-me\"\" response. The \"\"hatchet\"\" is only half buried at this point.\n\nAs for having a giant chip on my shoulder, how, in God's name, can describe me in such a way, after taking such an extremely magnaminous step in offering such an apology? One would only hope for praise for taking such a bold, magnanimous step, rather than yet further insults as to immaturity. My apology was indeed the most mature thing I've ever seen on wikipedia. Shame on you for giving me absolutely no credit for it. You're certainly a rather poor admin afterall. Block me again if you wish, if you feel I've insulted you. I'll just award myself another resilience barnstar for it.  \n\n\"",

Your non-profit donation will ultimately line the for-profit pockets of Jimmy Wales, Amazon, Google, the Bessemer Partners, and other corporate beneficiaries. How? Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine. As of December 2008, there are over 14,700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales' Wikia.com sites, which are funded by Google AdSense revenues. Did you know that Amazon invested $10,000,000 in the for-profit Wikia venture? It's therefore rather interesting that there are over 43,000 links to Amazon's retail site from the supposedly non-profit Wikipedia site. Isn't it? Meanwhile, did you know that the popular movie site IMDB.com is owned by Amazon, and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages? Well, surprise surprise  there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc. Its co-founder makes sure that the external linking environment on Wikipedia is hospitable for the Amazon link spamming machine! \n\nNow here is the really fascinating thing. If you go to Jimmy Wales' \"\"talk page\"\" on Wikipedia, and you ask him whether he feels that this obscene number of links to his for-profit site and those of his investors might be a conflict of interest or self-dealing, Jimbo won't even have time to respond. One or two of his sycophants will fairly promptly dismiss or erase your message; and if you try one more time to ask this question, you're likely to get blocked from editing Wikipedia altogether. Go ahead, try it\n\nTRUTH HURTS GUYS TRY THINKING WITH YOUR BRAIN INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING LIKE AN SHEEP, KEEP CHECKING ALL SITES FOR THE ABOVE TEXT PROXYS NEXT -)\"",
