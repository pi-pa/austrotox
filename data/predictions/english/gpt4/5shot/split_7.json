Now, you repeat homophobic insults and intertwine your own homosexuality with his identity, although he was a straight man stuck in a quicksand of backbiting, that included homophobic language.  Why perpetuate falsehoods, other than to make yourself feel better that somebody famous is alleged to be gay like you, especially if you like to smear him as a hypocrite, for all the abuse you suffered by fundie Bible thumpers?  It is obvious where you stand, or bend over, in this.  24.255.11.149  \n\n\"",

Precise definition is difficult to paraphrase, isn't it?\n\n\"\"other authorities agree that they will not overrule\"\"\ntheir agreement is not necessary, only the legal right to not be overruled \n\nDe facto sovereignty, the second, is actual power,  \n'the actual exercise'  'actually using'...etc.    of that power.  But 'power' that's a word that can't be used in this sense without FURTHER definition,because it's too ambiguous outside of a context that specifically implies what meaning is meant.                                  \n\nI think if we have the word 'exclusive' (the key point) in the opening paragraph, the rest can be saved for the later paragraph, where it is now... sparing people who just want the overview from reading mumbojumbo, but retaining the info for those who want a more thorough exposition.\n\nIf a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.\n\nI think this is a splendid summation of the concept of defacto sovereignty  I think if we \nkeep the defacto vs dejure info in the 'differing views' section, it ties together the 3 seemingly different views by the common thread of, \"\"no matter what your view is on sovereignty , you have to have it to use it and use it to have it\"\"\n\nand if we add your summary it makes the 'differing views' section just about right. \n\nA key element of sovereignty in the legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction. \n\nSpecifically, when a decision is made by a sovereign entity, it cannot generally be ovverruled by a higher authority.  Further, it is generally held that another legal element of sovereignty requires not only the legal right to exercise power, but the actual exercise of such power.  (\"\"no de jure sovereignty without de facto sovereignty\"\") In other words, neither claiming/being proclaimed Sovereign, nor merely exercising the power of a Sovereign is sufficient, sovereignty requires both elements. \n\nIf a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.\n\nBut if I may? I think this is one tiny bit better, as it applies to the anarchists, monarchs,etc:\nIf a sovereign - person or state - can make a decision but cannot carry it out, their recognized sovereignty is essentially meaningless.\n\nIn that form, I really like it.  How does that read to you? I think at this point the article is accurate, and pretty safe to expand on.  If the readability issue is good, (I'm blind to that, Ive read too much legalese to notice much if it sounds stilted or awkward), I'd say we are pretty set. Want to pick at it a bit and post your change?  I think it's a consensus at this point, pretty much.\"",

My complaint is therefore that in my opinion you are biased and using your administrative tools to promote that bias, a neutral party would have made the change instead of wasting my time here.

I know you are mad at me because I made fun of and replaced you horrible, terrible, ugly picture of Donnie Baseball, but calling me a rogue is the biggest outrage that I have ever seen.  Please delete that picture before all of us go blind, I would rather have no picture on the page then to have the worst picture in the history of the world on the page.  Don't ever delete my comments on any talk page ever again, I have the right to express my opinions. I am a villian but you just a hostage.  You can't stop the Reign of the King of Wikipedia.  Now go take some more pictures or something and stay outta my way. I'm out.",

ALL the east asian people I've spoken to thinks of Vietnam as a very integral part of SEA, and we all think you're backward, dirty and speak in a horrible swearing language.

I would not like to see you ever again at my talk page.  \n Don't worry if you don't want to, you won't see me. Now, what you will keep seen is the problems that you do have. You got into them and are still in them since months ago. Am I not right? And there is a subtle mistake that you are making when addressing them. Curious about what it is? I will be here. Sick and cruel maybe but that is only a manifestation of being plain and true, no fictitious colors, no hidden things. Good luck with your holy war.   \nOMG, how didn't I guess before. I know who you are. You left as  Dr. Jekyll, and you came back few days later as Mr. Hyde. You're really, really sick. You need to get some help. I feel sorry for you.  \n Is it really me who is sick? Maybe. Sort of a different illness as your, fortunately. Anyway, you don't want to look to what I am saying, no point to so much chitchatting. If you can really name my illnesses do so. It is useful and I don't mind.   \nIf you'd like to get a response at the message you left at Alison talk page, please remove it from there and re-post to you own talk page. As you rightly said Alison has nothing to do with the message that was addressed to me, and her talk page should be left alone.  \nI asked you to delete it from Alison's talk page, you only copied it. Please delete it, it does not belong there, and we'll talk,  \n Well, it does belong there. It is not only a message to you, it is also a message to the other two that were there. Why would I post it there if not because it completes a story only said in half? I said to continue here because the rest seems to be going to be about me. But notice the text there hints the readers here so that if they want to read more they know here to come. If I delete that paragraph there, not only info is lost there, but also nothing links to the continuation here.   \n\n..................................................\n\n(copied from another place)\n\nSole purpose? Just look my at my user contributions. Sorry, but you are prizing yourself too much thinking that the my sole purpose is to \"\"help you\"\". It is the other way around. Just by chance, I noticed that your problems had not stopped (since they even came to disrupt FPC). You are being a bit paranoid as you were when I reviewed one of your pictures in the most impersonal and objective way, as I always try to do. I just happens that among the things that I see, I support those that I think are right. No matter what. When I saw people doing wrong to you I condemned it. If I see you doing wrong I tell you. But not more than once. You say that I need some help. Go ahead, tell me the symptoms that you see. (In my talk page, since Alison should be annoyed with all these posts.) Abisharan (talk) \n\n...................................................\n\nCommon languages are all context dependent. This message is what it is within that contest. That's why I believe more in just copying.\n\n You are Spanish. \n\nYou said \"\"edulcorantion,\"\" which is close to edulcorante, or \"\"sugar.\"\"  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.107.144.106   \n I did. Although it is also a word in English that means the same thing as sweetening. Also chemist used for the action of rinsing a beaker with water. It is a nice word, specially if you already used sweet-ie in a previous sentence. Things sound better when you dont have to repeat words.   \"",

After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?Your username contains the insulting term 'bitches' which may offend other users.\n\nI'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.\n\nYou have several options freely available to you:\n If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.\n If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a \"\"third opinion\"\", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.\n If you decide to just go ahead and change your username, it is possible for you to keep your present contributions history under the new username: simply request a new name here following the guidelines on that page, rather than creating a whole new account.\n\nLet me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again!    \"",

Recently, I decided to turn a new leaf and become a decent, respectful contributor. I created an article called Adult Diapers in France. In this article, I included references and I hoped to create a series based on adult diaper production by country.\n\nWithin minutes , USRTOK Orbit slapped a speedy deletion notice onto my article, without even suggesting how to improve my article and claimed that I was 'advertising' and my page was 'unambiguously promotional'. This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article.\n\nSecondly, USRTOK claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first, then create my article. However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied. Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker.\n\nIn conclusion, I am getting fed up of wikipedia. I am getting fed up of how admins just pounce on you if you are a newbie. I am seriously thinking of trolling and vandalising again. Good day",

However, I now see that the original Megatron IS listed under \"\"Animation villains\"\", as is Galvatron, despite both also being listed under their respective villainous Transformers factions, which themselves are listed as \"\"Villain groups\"\".  There can't be a double standard here, I don't think.  I really think that this Megatron should indeed  be listed under the category \"\"Animation villains\"\".  I really don't think that saying he is simply a Predacon or a Vehicon is enough, as really he was far more than that, particularly in Beast Machines, where it actually seems that calling him a Vehicon is erroneous.  I mean, he created the Vehicons, and led them, but I don't think he really was one himself, no matter what form he was in.  So, I would really like to put him under the category \"\"Animation villains\"\", but I'm afraid someone would once again remove him from the category.\"",

When I read about the secret mailing list fiasco- I wanted to know the truth- so, not knowing that it was decided (for whatever reason) to stop pestering Durova with questions- I asked a simple question- which I did not intend to be a personal attack. Sorry if it was taken that way.\nP.S.- I remember someone (I believe it was Neil) citing my message on an anon's talk page against me because of my comment \"\"I'm looking into your identity.\"\". There's a misunderstanding here. I used to write for a school newspaper and I was doing research on a school computer (not logged in). I found that the IP of the computer I was using had done some bad edits in the past. I decided to write an article about it and also attempt to find who was vandalizing the pages- since it was someone at my school- I never meant it as a stalker-type thing. Sorry if it was taken that way...\n  \"",

I have cited a dictionary entry based solely on your statement that the word \"\"damn\"\" does not mean \"\"to be condemned by God,\"\" when, in fact it does.  As an atheist, you can rest assured that I am not offended by this phrase.  Who the fuck are you to determine that because you can't figure out the definition of a word when it is provided to you, that my entry is incorrect?  The fact that you retracted or edited my entry 3 times does not make it incorrect.  It means that you have been an idiot 3 times.  YOU are the one guilty of vandalizing my entry by removing it without a valid reason.  The fact that you have relatives that do not like the term God Damn for religious reasons is not relevent to this topic, and your argument concerning the entymology is fallacious.  Does any ever say \"\"Steve Damn\"\" or \"\"That stupid fuck SMcCandlish Damn\"\"?  No, they do not, beacuse to the followers of modern mythology (i.e. Christianity), the only thing capable of damning is God, hence the phrase \"\"God damn\"\" is redundant.\"",

Have a look at all the spew GabeMc posted on mine and Andreasesgde's talk pages that has not ben complained  about and it soon becomes apparent that the scales have been tipped in this now cocky editor's favour. You have to admit that complaining about an apologie on your talk page as harrassement it about as childish as the on looker that buys into his political antics. Me thinks a meatpuppet or even a sockpuppet  case will arise from this nonsense in the future. I find it way to hard to believe that so many editors can not feel like total idiots when they get caught not doing more than three minutes of investigation before acting. I am disgusted and come to realize the WP system is a complete and utter embarrasing joke. Gabe and I had an agreement (I won't disclose the details to protect him) and after the plan began to work he turned on me like a rabid dog. Some thanks. I disagreed with his edits and now watch him inject his non-approved the/The changes to Pink Floyd and other articles as  a cocky test to rape and pilage another few hundred music articles with his same the/The nonsense currently being mediated and under dispute. This guy isn't interested in furthering WP. He only wants to have his name in lights with [WP:Ownership]. I guess this IP is done and time to go back to account editing again. This was much more fun!

Then, her pussy is shaved, and vibrated to a noisy orgasm. She is cut, and her Master drinks her blood!  Then, Mazy is flogged in bondage, with closeups of her luscious breasts being pierced by needles. With Master Vicious. \n\n MULTIPLE MAZY  Flogging of Mazy; biting fondling DP vibrating writhing orgasms sobbing bondage screams, oh my!   \n\n CHAINED CAPTIVE  Delicate Mazy is chained helplessly with her arms overhead, while being flogged, her mouth is duct taped, she's held down and her breasts are pierced with needles. Some blood, intense.  \n\n DINNER PARTY  Dinner eaten off of Mazy! Some edge and wax play  \n\n DUTY CALLS Mazy orally services Master Vicious in her skimpy outfit, hot sex naturally ensues.  \n\n OO LA LA OW! Mazy dresses like a red and black can-can dancer, before being bent over and flogged \n\n SHAVE AND A TWAT SHOT Mazy's crotch is shaved, and the Master  Vicious carves his initials into her leg.

One usually doesn't change formats, especially in GAs.\n You removed a ref that was to the official site and where it was available online are replaced it with a book.\n I do relise that when a revert happens, a person gets a notice.  I was hoping you would spot the obvious error (#1) atleast,  but alas, you bark out idiot.\nI haven't clue why you did this as there was no reason.   I just fixed Angel (Madonna song).    \n First of all, try to understand why it was done. Did you open this reference and see whether Angel is present here at all or not? Guess not. Second of all, the book reference is the one to be used, PROMUSICAE be damned or not. Thirdly, hung medien is NOT the official site for old song in Spain, they post from 2004 onwards. And using both the book as well as the  template with the same reference name as \"\"spain\"\" gives a reference error. And \"\"One usually doesn't change formats, especially in GAs\"\" is not a reason for keeping errorneous false templates. — [ ChitChat ] \"",

        "Comment": "\"\n\nIf you think that Vaishnavas are born and die - than you are not to be delivered for millions of kalpas:\n\nI am sorry, but this is fact:\n\"\"Anyone who does not float in this inundation is most condemned. Such a person cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas.\nPURPORT\nThe kalpa is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ. One day of Brahmā is called a kalpa. A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.\"\"\n\nHowever, you are lucky:\nQ.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?\n\n \n\nA.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:\n\n \n\n(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.\n\n(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.\n\n(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.\n\n \n\nThen Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.\n\n          \n\nSo it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam\n\n        \n\nAlso Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, \"\"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time.\"\" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.\n\n \n\nQ.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?\n\n \n\nA.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.\n\n \n\nQ.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?\n\n \n\nA.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam. For example, translation into Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc. is very eas",

And yes, I have taken great pleasure in bringing a up-in-the-air editor come crashing to the ground, reminding them that they are not above the rules. Whether it is one word or a whole page, \"\"Fuck off idiot\"\" is a personal attack and warrants punishment. ~*~''''''~*~ \"",
