Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white country and ONLY into white countries. The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them. \n\n Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites. What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries? \n\n How long would it take anyone to realize I’m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem? And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn’t object to this?  \n\n But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews. \n\n They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white. \n\n Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white. \n 55",

She is second child in the family. Her parents divorced in 1998 and soon after her father remarried and had two more children. \nMarya, at the age of 4 began doing gymnastics, but quit two years later because she was denied a medal in a competition, where her age was incorrectly marked.

At the age of 11, Marya starred in Belarusfilm movie called “Dunechka”. Soon after she started to play in theatre and was featured in television shows. By 2005 her mother decided to move to United States. In September of 2005 Marya went to her first American school, Ingrid B. Lacy Middle School. She graduated in Spring 2006 and traveled back to Belarus for 2 months. In August 2006 she went to Oceana High School, from which she will graduate in 2010. \n\nMarya Dzmitruk is a member of ISAR (International Society for Astrological Research), also a member of a non-profit government organization which deals with human rights abuse throughout the world (also known as Helsinki Committee). Marya holds two diplomas from music schools, four scholarships for Lisa Spector’s Music school and several awards from YLI (Youth Leadership Institute). \n\nMarya has a very close relationship with her mother. Her personal life is “as happy as it could possibly get” a source says.

Heres a link to what the comment actually looked like: URLTOK\nThought it might as well stand there too since nothing but cencorship can be expected by some sheep on wikipedia only just recently realizing that his whole life, his wife and kids, is just there to serve a master, and therefore fanatically defending his beliefs to the contrary despite overwhelming evidence. You can go back you your boring life now Ian. I dont expect this \"\"no evidence from experts\"\" thread to stand for long anyway sheep. And this was supposed to be an objective lexcon!!! Learn something new everyday I guess, or as in your case, rather not because it would mean you life ment nothing:D Keep living in denial Ian, and dont forget to cencor!!!

Wiki is an Encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun. Anyway Business Week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of UST Global. FYI the link to the same URLTOK I think now you might have understood why I was removing this link before, when it was carrying outdated information.\n\n Can I ask you to check few pages in Wikipedia itself regarding UST Global content and find what i am trying to say here? This is very important. Could you please check the link URLTOK\n\nThis link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?\n\nAll you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (URLTOK\nAlso I want to repeat here that I am not here to violate any rules or policies of Wikipedia. I just want to point out the anomalies in this Wiki page. Could you please listen to my request. This is genuine.",

The closest thing I could see as anything remotely \"\"hateful\"\" was when they addressed the people (not the blacks, but the people) that want the removal of all Confederate symbols as \"\"rats\"\". According to their article, the \"\"rats\"\" are the leftists who are scapegoating the Confederacy for the monstrous deeds of Roof in the Charleston Shooting. There is no racial connontation or implication to this label, unless the only people wanting the symbols removed were exclusively black (and they aren't, given that much of this movement is pushed by whites). \n\n  \n    \"",

        "Comment": "I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.\n\nFirst thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.\n\nNow we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.\n\nThere's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.\n\nOk, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.\n\nA full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.\nYou must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.\nThe font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.\n\nNow, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",

What is so difficult for you to understand - it's FACT that's the way lagalese works - position statements are part of legalese.  You're saying you'd skip over the statement \"\"water is wet\"\" as original research.  Quite frankly your assertion that it is original research is LUDACRIS!  I don't know whether or not your intentionally mischaracterizing things, or whether you're truely this ignorant!\n There is a HUGE point in having this discussion - it's a refutation of avraham's assertion that the 1975 policy statement is irrelevant - but it's apparently a refutation that you don't have the knowledge of legalese to understand - which isn't my fault.  I'm not going to explain to you, a third time, the legalese equivalent of \"\"water is wet\"\"\n The simple FACT is you're wrong - it's not my problem that you don't have a good enough education to understand why despite my explaining it to you.  \"",

I did what you asked by writing in this talk page. Wikipedia even refers to the Kurdish language as language(s)which does not even make any sense. I am a Kurd myself, I know what I am talking about. Please give me at least 2 reliable sources that refers to the Kurdish language as language(s). The facts I wrote about the Kurdish language can even by seen on Wikipedia. I have information. I have studied. You act as if I am just using information I got out of nowhere. When in fact, it is those people that you allow to change information, which create these problems. You did not even allow anybody to look at my proposal before you jumped in, I posted this proposal only a few hours ago.",

        "Comment": "- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.\n\nIt's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. \n\nGood ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.\n\nFor example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.\n\nIt's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.\n\nAnd too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.\nGood riddance!!",

And given that Polish is not the indigenous language of the area, the Kashubian name, Gduńsk, would be the proper name by that standard. But since we do not call Warsaw Warszawa only because the region was an integral part of Poland, your reasoning makes no sense in the first place. People need to finally come to terms (again) with the concept of exonyms, dammit!",

Now, I'm no expert on idiocy, but is TimVickers isn't an idiot then I don't know what is. Please, I beg of you, block me for the right thing, and apply the rules equally you pathetic excuse for an admin. I've gone from not caring, to being embarassed that I haven't actually been fairly blocked for actions I wanted to be blocked for (as can be seen in the comments that lead to it). Imbecile. -",

Noteworthinness depends on whoever considers a thing noteworthy, not \"\"consensus\"\". Your \"\"this is not noteworthy to \"\"we\"\" is an immature stop making cheap shot.

Oh, and blanking your talk page is your right but it isn't impressive. . , talk \n\nI blanked the page because there was a lot of unnecessary old stuff on it.  \n\nI know the NPOV extremely well and I'm always fighting against the EXTREME POV of Evolutionists.  The stuff I changed on Flood Geology is an example of extreme evolutionary POV.  I changed it to reflect reality.  Problem is, most Eovlutionists are completely unable to see their own POV.  And most of the editors of Flood Geology are not geologists.  I am an undergrad paleontologist.\n\nStop edit warring please\nStop edit warring on Flood geology to insert fringe claims, or you will be blocked. Please read WP:3RR, too.  | talk .\n\nThis topic is about a fringe belief so it ought to accurately reflect what flood geologists actually say.  But it is nonsense and full of misinformation and outright lies.  Not one of the editors defending the Evolutionary faith are geologists.  They just keep repeating the same nonsense debunked by creationists ages ago.     \nThe topic is about a fringe belief, so it ought to be written from a fringe point of view..? No, that's a mistake. For the amount of attention, and kind of attention, that is appropriate to what creationists have or have not \"\"debunked\"\", see WP:UNDUE. Try to take Wikipedia policies on board, or you will find yourself blocked.  | talk .\nI didn't say \"\"written from a fringe POV\"\" I said it should reflect what flood geologists actually say, not what enemies says they say.  There is a big difference.  If critics wish to comment on what flood geologists actually say, fine.  But at least the actual position of flood geologists should be accurately presented.  As written, the page is deeply flawed and pushes a single POV.  The problem is that most evolutionists are totally ignorant of and blind to their POV pushing.  They actually think that they have no bias!! I am very familiar with WP policies, which I why I'm trying to get fair hearing instead of the deeply biased presentations currently on WP.     \nYou're misrepresenting your edits.The reason I warn you against edit warring is that you have recently reverted three times, within a short period of time, to insert one and the same change to the article: from \"\"This was interpreted as being the result of massive flooding, though it is now known that they are the product of ice age glaciations (an unknown phenomenon at that time)\"\" to \"\"This was interpreted as being the result of massive flooding, though it is now interpreted as the product of ice age glaciations (an unknown phenomenon at that time).\"\" And you say that change is about \"\"the actual position of flood geologists\"\"? No it isn't. You're changing, over and over, the description of the position of mainstream science. That's the exact opposite of what you claim to be doing. If you're \"\"very familiar with WP policies\"\", I have to suppose you simply don't like them. I'm afraid I'm going to enforce them just the same: don't edit war any more, on this or any other article, or I will block you.  | talk .\nAnd you honestly don't see the POV in \"\"known\"\" versus \"\"interpreted\"\"?  Good grief.  You could say \"\"generally interpreted\"\", \"\"almost always interepreted\"\" or possibly someting like \"\"the current consensus is that it is\"\" and they would all probably be acceptable.  Consensus is an opinion.  Present it as fact and you are pushing POV.  Unfortunately majority POV is generally accepted as no POV on WP.  That is a serious flaw, and a significant hit to WP's credibility.  Also, it take at least two to edit war.  It does no good to cry \"\"foul\"\" when another editor is as determined as you are over a differnce.  \n\n Flood Geology Request for Comment \n\nThere is a RfC on Talk:Flood geology regarding a statement in the lead of the article.  I don't know if you watchlist this article, but your input would be appreciated.  \n\nWeight\nI know you think the scientific community is wrong, but please re",

Science, nature etc are not discussed (or mentioned only slightly), the novels main topic is the coexistence of men and women. The title has no meaning in Hungarian (and I suppose, neither in English or in Esperanto). In Hungarian, the most similar word it may associate with is “capillar”, but I do not know why: I have not found yet anything related to capillars in the novel.\n\nIn some editions, these two novels were published in one book (sometimes under supertitle “Gulliver's new travels”). But their topic is not related. Only a formal relatedness exists: Voyage to Faremido is presented as the fifth, Capillaria as the sixth travel of Gulliver.\n\nBest wishes",
