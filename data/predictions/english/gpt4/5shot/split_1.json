I scrapped and rewrote the \"\"Early Years\"\" section of the biography because after reading the source I realized it was being plagiarized.  It *is* based on an in-movement source (another section of the same website, published by Living Stream Ministry), and I tried to note that in the article so the reader would know this.  Wish we had a more neutral source.  Tried to make sure events were being described dispassionately.  Areas still to work on:  \"\"Later Years\"\", and the rest of the article beginning with \"\"Ministry and Teachings\"\". \n ::::::   \"",

He was not hardcore Muslim nor was he backed by hardcore Muslims...but it were Pashtuns who stopped him in his actions.

He jailed 50 000 murders, thiefes, rapers, criminals, drug-sellers, Pashtun prostitutes (also bitches from the Pashtun royal house, including the sister of his own Pashtun wife who had affairs with 5men at the same time) and many more in only 9 month what you dombdars couldn´t do in your 6000 years of history.

I watched and found it was the most dreadful, inane, asinine address I have ever heard.  Key phrases from the speech which give a hint as to its character include: \"\"I'm proud to be a member of the G.O.P.  The Grand Old Party. (dramatic pause) Are you??!\"\"  I remember NBC News cut away after a few minutes of this foolishness and David Brinkley said, \"\"I think someone was kidding us about that speech being the greatest of all time.\"\"  The fact that I can still remember this after 31 years says something about how terrible it was.  I in fact only checked this Wikipedia entry to see if there was any mention about what a scandal Vander Jagt caused by his utterly awful speech.\"",

Accusing me of dubious unsourced content when everything has references. Accusing me of unnecessary external links. Is this a Wikipedia or Yourpedia, for removing images so people wouldn't see them. There are many other such \"\"wikipedians\"\" among the lawmakers throughout the world. That's why we live in a prison. You have the arogancy to come from nowhere and start \"\"edit\"\" something that you haven't made, you haven't checked, just because someone like you made you an admin. And than, the hero moves to another one. Who the hell you think you are, little boy. \"\"Editors\"\" and \"\"anti-vandalism\"\" heros like you roam around only in search of the next \"\"expert-tag\"\" on their page. They do not create. They play for score, in the meantime thay may do something creative. One like you apologized to me just for the same type of \"\"excellent\"\" job. I bet you live for this, isn't it, little boy. This is your food. Without it you're dead. You're nobody. \"\"...not very useful to our readers...\"\" You, arrogant child, are useless to the Wikipedia readers. You are that someone who brakes the essence of Wikipedia - \"\"the free enciclopedia\"\". \"\"Please stop. And please stop attacking other editors or you will be blocked from editing\"\". Please this, please that would not hide the abomination. \"\"...please stop attacking other editors...\"\" It's really interesting, this is what the guilty always say, protecting themselves from what they know would come, if they don't make the first move. \"\"Attack is the best defence\"\", was that one of the credos of the pseudo-intellectuals. Immatures like you are so disgustingly simple. You are nobody. You can't block someone just because they gave you the \"\"keys to the house\"\". If other, uncorrupted by you, admin takes my side, you'll give a little fight and than you'll stand down like a puppy. You see now who, or should i say what you are, hero. You are nobody. You're not even a real employee of the Wikipedia. You're just one of the thousands underaged, in therms of mind or even age, wannabes. You're a joke. Your god Jimmy Wales use you as a tissue, while making his money. You're a joke even to him. If you only knew how many people like me notice this but stay quiet, just because they want to be part of the herd. How about that. It looks like you're a joke not just for people like me, a.\nVery sad picture, a little boy trying to feel he counts for something. Grab a cigar, you might just start looking like adult.  Enjoy your \"\"power\"\" from behind the screen, and pray we never meet.\"",

I have understood that users on wikipedia have far greater leeway on their own user talk pages and user pages, and asking other users to stay off is an accepted practice.  My comments on the Sarah Palin edit summary probably went over the line and deserved either a warning or 1 day block because of the article probation, and I should not have reacted the way I did to the other users instigation.  But again I note that I did not notice you posting a similar warning to the user who said in his edit summary towards me \"\"then stop posting biased crap\"\" . \nYour entitled to do whatever the fuck you want on wikipedia Coffee because you have the powers which are very hard to take away, but really learn how to read what you link to.

Of corse the Empire has all the rights to take (i.e. not steal, just annex, colonize, brainwash, tax, aso) to land initially. They have the army to come and take any land they feel like. Of course if the Empire is weakened for 10-20 years because of a peasant revolution, it is wrong to steal back that land. Come on, who are Charlie's pa to steal back from that Empire? And who are they to even listen to what they have to say. An empire is an Empire and as long as they have a big enough big bloody army to it in the East of Charlie's land there is absolutly no point to argue agains. Otherwise people will come and say Charlie's pa stole the land from us, but we never stole it in the first place, because we do not have an expansionist and ignorant attitude about tiny Charlies.

The challenge is to direct that energy into positive uses.\n\nTwo years ago an editor approached me for help; he had a block log an arm long (seven edit warring blocks).  He was working in an important but controversial area.  We communicated.  Tentatively at first; then more closely.  Not only has he never been blocked since then, but he's become one of Wikipedia's most prolific featured content contributors.  He has since become a sysop at four different WMF sites, is an OTRS volunteer, and was recently reelected as an arbitrator at Wikinews.  He still edits that same controversial topic, and has written two-thirds of its featured articles and good articles.\n\nWhat he told me about his blocks was this: he treated them exactly as blocks are intended to bebreathing room.  He'd go out, get fresh air, do other things.  Then return relaxed and refreshed.\n\nI don't mentor anymore, but if you'd like to seek a mentor I'd be glad to communicate with both you and the mentor.  Best wishes, 305 \"",

I would do these myself, but I'm still getting to grips with how to use references and sources. In the meanwhile, I thought that perhaps you could take a look at these links and add to the article accordingly:\n\nURLTOK (Topics on March 15th protests. Almost all have some sort of photographic evidence)\n\nURLTOK (Anonymous code of conduct.)\n\nUnfortunantely there appears to be very, very little media coverage on quite a few details concerning Anonymous, which is somewhat frustrating. BTW, don't forget about the comments I posted in the actual Chanology topic. If you need to discuss this drop me a line. kthxbai.",

It was quickly reverted by Shabazz who wrongly claimed that what I had done was \"\"as good as deleting it\"\" - certainly anyone who is honest and non-biased in this situation would disagree.  I merely placed the paragraph in question into a different area and trimmed it a bit.  Unless someone was determined to make this paragraph more important than the action of the JIDF (as I am claiming) than the statement about me doing something as bad as deleting it would not be true.  Therefore, I feel there are hostile intentions here and I'm not concerned about people with whom I do not respect nor with whom I feel do not have good intentions ganging up on me.  I can handle it.  Also, I've been thinking about it.  Since Shabazz essentially told me to get lost, I think I'm going to stick around and get LOUDER.  Also, I'm going to get many more of my friends (with whom I do respect and with whom have NOBLE intentions) to start getting involved-because this is F'in ridiculous.  \"",

If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio \n\n \"\"Adult-child sex\"\" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled \"\"Adult-child sex\"\" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article \"\"Nazi genocide\"\" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled \"\"Nazi demographic adjustments\"\". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   \n\n Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08\n\nI don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio \"",

I really don't care, ban me, i've done nothing wrong and i'll just change my IP Address and get a new account if it comes down to it, so just come on and ban me and continue to live in your little fairytale land since apparently it makes you feel more important in life because you're an admin, whoopee.\n\nUpdate from Axeman 10: It wasn't a personal attack on you, Scarian, this is the only way i'm able to reply to your annoying warnings, just ban me already, you pathetic loser, i told you all you need to know, you're just stuck is this sad little fantasyland where everything's overly-politically correct, just ban me already, and stop messaging me, i don't respect you, or any other admin! )\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n\"",

But you cannot mention this without also pointing out that this was in large because Communist parties made it the established view in the states they governed.   The association is a historical one, not a logical one, and it is true that there are critics of atheism who try to discredit atheism as a philosophy because of its historical association with Communism (a point mentioned in the article), but the NPOV response to this is NOT just to neglect to mention this important historical association.  12:28, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)",

I know the catholic church forbids it, but come on we all jerk off.  and we all have done the old rusty trombone every once in a while, that's the problem with uptight cardinals from the catholic church, you guys are afraid of sex.  its like you guys want to forget that cumming feels fucking awesome, you should try it some time.  seriously go to redtube.com go to the anal sex page and just go nuts.   \n Lets not forget that the term is completely wrong, masturbate, in the dictionary, refers to pleasuring yourself, NOT reaching around to jerk off another man.  By the way what is a \"\"cardinal\"\" of the catholic church doing reading about rusty trombone's early Sunday morning during LENT?  I know what your thinking, what am I doing looking this up? The answer is simple, my girlfriend is a freak.  She has been asking me to do freaky shit to her since I met her at my church function, but I am a protestant, so I guess you should fear me or you think I am going to hell.  well you know what I CAN'T WAIT.  I would rather laugh with the sinners then cry with the saints.   \n\n peace out\"",

Removing CC Youth Division could make a bit more sense, but the group is also mentioned in the article, though as Young Boys which simply is an old name. So please, stop your amateurish source-checks, where you remove firms that actually are mentioned in the given sources and are generally a fucking cunt. Thank you in advance.\n\n== \"",

Speidel's scapegoating of Rommel is fully described by Ralf Georg Reuth's book, Rommel the End of a Legend, yet you insist on deleting this uncomfortable truth about this serpentine operator turned post-war German idol and insert some nonsense about Stülpnagel screaming Rommel's name under torture. what could possibly be the basis for that, I shudder to think?. Have you or your sources been holding seanses with the July 20 conspirators?. Oh and this is truely exquisite. you claim that Speidel's being a linchpin of the conspiracy cast further suspicion on Rommel, but Neubius, Had Speidel been Known to be a member of the conspiracy he would have been executed!!! Where is your brain? Indeed his very survival would suffice to prove that he scapegoated Rommel, for he had no other superiors to scapegoat. As it happens there are trancripts of his testemony to the Gestapo. Yours, the much dismayed Soz.",

I guess nothing I wrote actually registered, which in a way supports the second part of what I wrote. I'm sorry to be critical, but after two weeks of this crap, day in, day out, getting hammered with warnings and other bogus edits, and even trying to step back for the last four days, and still seeing myself blamed by you for this, and insulted, and generally treated as just as much crap as the person actively doing all of this, I had to say something. And you're still doing it.",

Whatever sources you have used to mention that \"\"6000 marcos are operating and 1000 are on reserve\"\" , i would appreciate you to mention that source on the page, and if it all it is true i suggest you keep it to yourself because neither has the Indian Navy nor the Indian Defence ministry ever released the number of Marcos. Please do not challenge the secrecy of the unit. People who have enough evidence to suggest that marcos are secretive will understand that your mentioning of their strength, will find it irrelevant. \n 2) the picture of a man on-board a ship in black overalls with his face shown is DEFINITELY not Marco, delete that picture, and do not reassign if anybody removes it. That man is part of indian navy infantry, please understand. check the photo again. its actually a disgrace for this elite if u put such irrelevant pictures. \n 3) editing certain repeated words and sentences should be allowed in that page. It is everybody's page. Anybody can provide accurate information. \n The number 0.27 sec for reaction is again an invalid edit. please remove it and use simple words to suggest their capability neither one of us are in marcos and it is highly unlikely that you have visited INS abhimanyu to have a look.    \n\n \"",

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! \nHow long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?\nWith a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. \nI have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. \nI have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?\nHa ha ha ha ha!\nSee how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!\nAnd that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!\nAnd now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! \nTears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!\nDANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!\nHow glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! \nNO! \nBuddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?\nThen, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! \nAiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...\n\nTHE END",

Disputing an assertion DOES NOT CONSTITUTE presuming the reverse.  I have attempted to explain this to you again and again, and you are either unable or unwilling to grasp this simple concept.\n\nThe discrepancy between God vs Moses doing the writing does not automatically suggest that the text was different.\nI never said that it does.  It does, however, destroy your argument, because clearly the two passages don't refer to the same act of writing.\n\nThat is what I mean by \"\"plain meaning\"\".\nLet us be clear here.  You just asserted that that which you claim is my position (which, by the way, is not my position) has not been proven, and then you declare that that is what you mean by \"\"plain meaning\"\".  In other words, you just admitted that your position is based entirely on argument from ignorance: your intepretation is not proven to be incorrect, therefore it is the \"\"plain meaning\"\".\n\nTry not to be rude - my comprehension is fine.\nNo, clearly it's not.  And trying to pass your intepretation off as \"\"plain reading\"\" is rude.\n\nYou can accuse me of WP:NPOV and WP:NOR violations all you like, but I have advanced a number of arguments - based on 3000 years of what you call \"\"erroneous\"\" interpretations - that you have not actually disproven.\nNo, y ou haven't advanced a number of arguments.  You have advanced one arguments, which I have shown to invalid.  And as I said above, the burden of proof is not on me to disprove your position, I but on you to prove it.  And as I have already pointed out, even if you WERE to present a convincing arugment for your argument, that would not address the NPOV or NOR issues.  Finally, I never said \"\"erroneous\"\", and I don't appreciate your misrepresenting my position.\n\nI asked you not to make any more edits to the article, especially when they violate WP:POINT\nYou were already in violation of WP:NPOV and WP:NOR, and now you're in flagrant violation of WP:AGF  \"",

SHE is the one that needs to stay cool and SHE is the one, along with her 'friends', who need to quit deleting the links to EBAN and EB Info World and stop claiming that EBAN is an illegal organization (lies) and that EB Info World is full of misinformation (more lies). All she is capable of doing is lying. Lies lies, lies. I never met a bigger vindictive liar in my entire life.",

THE ONLY REAL GOLDENTONY111/112 ACCOUNTS ARE ON HERE. \n\nCHECK MY DEVIANTART PROFILE, SET UP IN 2006\nTHIS ACCOUNT IS THE ONLY REAL GOLDENTONY111 ACCOUNT. A MORONIC TROLL HAS SET UP ACCOUNTS ON THE WEB WITH MY USERNAME & FALSE IDS, WHICH AREN'T ME BUT A CHILDISH ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE ME WITH SLURS & A FAKE PHOTO. CHECK JOIN DATE; 2006 NOT 2011. HE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION & SO WORRIED ABOUT IT HE IS CREATING ACCOUNTS ASKING IF HE COULD BE IN TROUBLE. HE IS. THE ONLY REAL GOLDENTONY111/112 ACCOUNTS ARE ON HERE.\n\nSome of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.\n\nApparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.\n\nI do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.\n\nI'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a \"\"mum\"\" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking \"\"research\"\" from questionable sources and only ever \"\"research\"\" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have \"\"won\"\" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)\n\nBasically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.\n\nYoutube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.\n\nI encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to list",

Nevertheless, I don't mind telling you that I have tried in the past, while doing the primary work on the article, to use block quotes for precisely the purpose you suggest (I am tempted to say great minds think alike but I will restrain myself), but I could not get that function to work unless the text was up against the left margin, and, as you know, one of the shitty aspects of the article is my use of tables and images, of which I happen to be rather proud. If you know how block quotes can be used in this situation, I would welcome your helpful advice. I value clarity as much as you do.",
