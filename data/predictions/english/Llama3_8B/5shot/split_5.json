What's up, Doc? \n\nI'm not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I'm talkng about)!\nOh, we know what you're talking about, all right. Trust me.   \nHis IP is French, so, yeah, I won't hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. \nBack on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that 'expert ~= god' - that is a skill that many people lack.

His methods are unquestionably scientific, which of course explains why so few high profile psychics and fakers apply for the million dollar challenge.    \nI added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.   \n\n Works for me.  I'm guessing if he can teach college without a high-school degree, he could have attended college as well.  -)    \n\nThe IP again demonstrates that he's either a troll or an idiot, or both.

Pikachunes (featured on wikipedia), is a serious upcoming NZ electronic music artist. Many external sources confirm Pikachunes as a notably significant act (which is why he is on Wikipedia I suppose). Monday records have recently signed Pikachunes, so I think that makes Monday Records notable by association. Regardless of the Pikachines connection, I also think that an independent record label signing exciting new acts such as this is very notable. I believe (as with most music artist enteries) it is entirley appropriate to include a wiki page on this up coming independent record label, as they sign more and more culturally significant acts such as Pikachunes. Wikipedia is a common source of reference for the music industry, and it is very common place for relevant record labels to be featured along with artists. As well as links to the Monday Records site, I also linked to 3rd party music news blogs who announced the new signing, as they also felt it newsworthy and culturally significant. Please can you restore the article, or let me know what more I can do. Thank you for your time. All the best.",

FREE popcorn, too! Whoopee! Best wishes from Jimini Cricket 97.123.26.228  \"",

Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)\n\n3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)\n\nOh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)\n\nJESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.\n\nTake a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?\n\nLook at this page  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  \"",

The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards.\n\nThis is how the statement read before you edited it:\n\n\"\"Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room.

So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads:\n\n\"\"The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air.\"\"\"\"\n\n...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful.\n\nI saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say \"\"Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!\"\". I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the \"\"bone-chilling\"\" factor into the mix.\n\nAnyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article.

My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.\n\nTo that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure.",
