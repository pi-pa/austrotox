If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio \n\n \"\"Adult-child sex\"\" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled \"\"Adult-child sex\"\" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article \"\"Nazi genocide\"\" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled \"\"Nazi demographic adjustments\"\". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   \n\n Exactly as Hero said.

Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio \"",

I know the catholic church forbids it, but come on we all jerk off.  and we all have done the old rusty trombone every once in a while, that's the problem with uptight cardinals from the catholic church, you guys are afraid of sex.  its like you guys want to forget that cumming feels fucking awesome, you should try it some time.  seriously go to redtube.com go to the anal sex page and just go nuts.   \n Lets not forget that the term is completely wrong, masturbate, in the dictionary, refers to pleasuring yourself, NOT reaching around to jerk off another man.  By the way what is a \"\"cardinal\"\" of the catholic church doing reading about rusty trombone's early Sunday morning during LENT?  I know what your thinking, what am I doing looking this up? The answer is simple, my girlfriend is a freak.  She has been asking me to do freaky shit to her since I met her at my church function, but I am a protestant, so I guess you should fear me or you think I am going to hell.  well you know what I CAN'T WAIT.  I would rather laugh with the sinners then cry with the saints.   \n\n peace out\"",

A recent series of short autobiographies seems interesting though I believe the Alun Watkins book was described as anodyne.\nIncidentally I believe a tension has grown up between Cricketarchive and the ACS.(Last AGM) Oh and I am not a member but know several very well.)",
