And I don't care what that long haired, anti-punk hippie Cobain was quoted as saying. You're going to depend your grunge history and contradict punk's with only ONE quote? And from a hippie who was part of a movement that helped bring punk down? That makes NO sense. I'm going to provide plenty a quote when the time comes that will vastly overshadow the quotes you have. And you godamn better not re-edit or I'll have you banned! I've done it before and I'll do it again!\n\nBy the way, I'm damn happy that idiot Cobain died. He did nothing for punk but bury it using stupid american grunge music. You lame americans don't know anything about and have no taste for style, fashion, or music.",

        "Comment": "- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.\n\nIt's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. \n\nGood ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.\n\nFor example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.\n\nIt's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.\n\nAnd too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.\nGood riddance!!",

Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of <vulgarity>idiocy</vulgarity> was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.\n\nIt's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD <vulgarity>nerds</vulgarity> who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. \n\nGood <vulgarity>****ing</vulgarity> luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive <vulgarity>nerdishm</vulgarity>. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the <vulgarity>crap</vulgarity> that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.\n\nFor example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is <vulgarity>shitted</vulgarity> all over, if you ever need any help.\n\nIt's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many <vulgarity>nerds</vulgarity> for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.\n\nAnd too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.\nGood riddance!!",

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! \nHow long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?\nWith a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. \nI have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. \nI have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?\nHa ha ha ha ha!\nSee how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!\nAnd that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!\nAnd now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! \nTears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!\nDANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!\nHow glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! \nNO! \nBuddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?\nThen, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! \nAiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...\n\nTHE END",

        "Comment": "\" \n\n == How about Personal Behavior? == \n\n I agree with you Enigmatical, and I am frustrated by this definition of a word I thought I understood quite well.  When you say one thing, but do another, AND justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is hypocrisy.  But I guess I'm wrong.  Apparently we can never know what someone Actualy believes or feels, because they may be Lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs.  Therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their Actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrites.  This is making my head spin, and hurt alot.   \n\n I really think we need a WORD to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or whatever.  Putting it under \"\"double standard\"\" is not putting a WORD to it.  For instance, say I'm playing an online game, and I meet someone who Kills me, and claims they hate it when people Kill others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been killed by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players.  I am a victim of a victim.  Is this an example of hypocrisy?  Or is it an example of \"\"double standard\"\"?  If it is a \"\"double standard\"\" being applied by the one who killed me, what words do I use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior?  \"\"You are a Hypocrite!\"\" apparently does not apply, so, do I say \"\"You are applying a Double Standard!\"\"?  Somehow it just doesn't have the same Punch.   \n\n To me \"\"Double Standard\"\" relates only to how one decides how different groups should be treated based on their behavior.  If a man commits murder, and whether he is found guilty or not depends solely on the color of his skin, that is a Double Standard, aka Racism.  The differences between how Women and Men are treated in the work place, or by employers, is another example.  A woman can get maternity leave to take care of a new baby, but a man cannot.  I detect a Double Standard there as well. \n\n If I constantly and publicly state that I am against circumcision in all cases, and then have my own child circumcised, am I a hypocrite?  If I am totaly against abortion, but force my daughter to have an abortion, am I a hypocrite?  Have I actualy stated my real beliefs, or was I lieing?  Was my behavior based on my REAL beliefs, and my stated beliefs were lies?  My head hurts too much to keep going. \n\n This is all My Humble Opinion, and I am probably quite stupid and an idiot.\"",
        "Comment_marked": "\" \n\n == How about Personal Behavior? == \n\n I agree with you Enigmatical, and I am <vulgarity>frustrated</vulgarity> by this definition of a word I thought I understood quite well.  When you say one thing, but do another, AND justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is <vulgarity>hypocrisy</vulgarity>.  But I guess I'm wrong.  Apparently we can never know what someone Actualy believes or feels, because they may be Lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs.  Therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their Actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrites.  This is making my <vulgarity>head</vulgarity> spin, and hurt alot.   \n\n I really think we need a WORD to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or w<vulgarity>hate</vulgarity>ver.  Putting it under \"\"<vulgarity>double standard\"\"</vulgarity> is not putting a WORD to it.  For instance, say I'm playing an online game, and I meet someone who <vulgarity>Kill</vulgarity>s me, and claims they <vulgarity>hate</vulgarity> it when people <vulgarity>Kill</vulgarity> others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been <vulgarity>killed</vulgarity> by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players.  I am a victim of a victim.  Is this an example of <vulgarity>hypocrisy</vulgarity>?  Or is it an example of \"\"<vulgarity>double standard\"\"</vulgarity>?  If it is a \"\"<vulgarity>double standard\"\"</vulgarity> being applied by the one who <vulgarity>killed</vulgarity> me, what words do I use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior?  \"\"You are a <vulgarity>Hypocrite</vulgarity>!\"\" apparently does not apply, so, do I say \"\"You are applying a Double Standard!\"\"?  Somehow it just doesn't have the same <vulgarity>Punch</vulgarity>.   \n\n To me \"\"Double Standard\"\" relates only to how one decides how different groups should be treated based on their behavior.

        "Comment": "\"\nok,  this misses some of the key points and misstates it a bit. I appreciate your effort though.  Precise definition is difficult to paraphrase, isn't it?\n\n\"\"other authorities agree that they will not overrule\"\"\ntheir agreement is not necessary, only the legal right to not be overruled \n\nDe facto sovereignty, the second, is actual power,  \n'the actual exercise'  'actually using'...etc.    of that power.  But 'power' that's a word that can't be used in this sense without FURTHER definition,because it's too ambiguous outside of a context that specifically implies what meaning is meant.                                  \n\nI think if we have the word 'exclusive' (the key point) in the opening paragraph, the rest can be saved for the later paragraph, where it is now... sparing people who just want the overview from reading mumbojumbo, but retaining the info for those who want a more thorough exposition.\n\nIf a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.\n\nI think this is a splendid summation of the concept of defacto sovereignty  I think if we \nkeep the defacto vs dejure info in the 'differing views' section, it ties together the 3 seemingly different views by the common thread of, \"\"no matter what your view is on sovereignty , you have to have it to use it and use it to have it\"\"\n\nand if we add your summary it makes the 'differing views' section just about right. \n\nA key element of sovereignty in the legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction. \n\nSpecifically, when a decision is made by a sovereign entity, it cannot generally be ovverruled by a higher authority.  Further, it is generally held that another legal element of sovereignty requires not only the legal right to exercise power, but the actual exercise of such power.  (\"\"no de jure sovereignty without de facto sovereignty\"\") In other words, neither claiming/being proclaimed Sovereign, nor merely exercising the power of a Sovereign is sufficient, sovereignty requires both elements. \n\nIf a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.\n\nBut if I may?

        "Comment_marked": "\"\nok,  this misses some of the key points and misstates it a bit. I appreciate your effort though.  Precise definition is difficult to paraphrase, isn't it?\n\n\"\"other authorities agree that they will not overrule\"\"\ntheir agreement is not necessary, only the legal right to not be overruled \n\nDe facto sovereignty, the second, is actual power,  \n'the actual exercise'  'actually using'...etc.    of that power.  But 'power' that's a word that can't be used in this sense without FURTHER definition,because it's too ambiguous outside of a context that specifically implies what meaning is meant.                                  \n\nI think if we have the word 'exclusive' (the key point) in the opening paragraph, the rest can be saved for the later paragraph, where it is now... sparing people who just want the overview from reading mumbojumbo, but retaining the info for those who want a more thorough exposition.\n\nIf a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.\n\nI think this is a splendid summation of the concept of defacto sovereignty  I think if we \nkeep the defacto vs dejure info in the 'differing views' section, it ties together the 3 seemingly different views by the common thread of, \"\"no matter what your view is on sovereignty , you have to have it to use it and use it to have it\"\"\n\nand if we add your summary it makes the 'differing views' section just about right. \n\nA key element of sovereignty in the legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction. \n\nSpecifically, when a decision is made by a sovereign entity, it cannot generally be ovverruled by a higher authority.  Further, it is generally held that another legal element of sovereignty requires not only the legal right to exercise power, but the actual exercise of such power.  (\"\"no de jure sovereignty without de facto sovereignty\"\") In other words, neither claiming/being proclaimed Sovereign, nor merely exercising the power of a Sovereign is sufficient, sovereignty requires both elements. \n\nIf a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.\n\nBut if I may? I think this is one tiny bit better, as it applies to the anarchists, monarchs,etc:\nIf a sovereign - person or state - can make a decision but cannot carry it out, their recognized sovereignty is essentially meaningless.\n\nIn that form, I really like it.
