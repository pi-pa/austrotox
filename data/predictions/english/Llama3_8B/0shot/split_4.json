        "Comment": "Marya Dzmitruk was born in Minsk, Belarus in March 19, 1992. Her mother, Olga Nikolaevna Moroz was born in Baranovichi, Belarus and her father was born in Brest, Belarus. She is second child in the family. Her parents divorced in 1998 and soon after her father remarried and had two more children. \nMarya, at the age of 4 began doing gymnastics, but quit two years later because she was denied a medal in a competition, where her age was incorrectly marked. When she turned 6 years old, she got admitted to Music School #4 in Minsk, class of violin, and to Public School #66 with piano classes as a main course. At the age of 11, Marya starred in Belarusfilm movie called “Dunechka”. Soon after she started to play in theatre and was featured in television shows. By 2005 her mother decided to move to United States. In September of 2005 Marya went to her first American school, Ingrid B. Lacy Middle School. She graduated in Spring 2006 and traveled back to Belarus for 2 months. In August 2006 she went to Oceana High School, from which she will graduate in 2010. \n\nMarya Dzmitruk is a member of ISAR (International Society for Astrological Research), also a member of a non-profit government organization which deals with human rights abuse throughout the world (also known as Helsinki Committee). Marya holds two diplomas from music schools, four scholarships for Lisa Spector’s Music school and several awards from YLI (Youth Leadership Institute). \n\nMarya has a very close relationship with her mother. Her personal life is “as happy as it could possibly get” a source says. She is currently dating Alex K., from Odessa, Ukraine. \n\nMarya currently attends school and works for ISAR and Helsinki Committee at her own free time.",

Debut, peak and how many weeks charting.\n\nTrack listing\nNot needed, only one version.\n\nCharts\n2012 peaks should be in a separate table to 2013 peaks.\n\nRelease history\nBeing given digital download makes it a single, not a promo single. Promo singles are free and cannot chart. So this is questionable.\nThe Region column needs the same shaded mark up as the Charts table.\n\nRefs\nThe first one isn't even formatted.\nRef 3 needs linking for MTV and Viacom\nRef 7 therefore needs unlinking\n\nExternal links\nSome sort of red link All Around the World template needs removing.\n\nStatus\nOn hold  — aron \"",

I will say this, it is obvious to me and to my advocate that though you assume what Willmcw says to be true, the edits I made were in fact worthy, and not only will your reply be redirected to my advocate but also to a host of otehr administrators. This has become such a trying time that I've been granted the ability to switch to a new identity and leave your vicious attacks behind. You have proven to be a slimy loose moralled child who spends too much time at wikipedia tryong to bully others out of the edits you have only taken up since this July. Whihc translates to the fac that your 'job' at 23 leaves you such an amount of free time that you can sling insults and barbs online rather than actually do positive work at Wikipedia. Whereas my edits may not have been as substantial as your own, my sockpuppetry related to willmcw, or at least buddying upo wiht him, has not been as pervasive as your own. I'm leaving. I'm fed up with the typical acne faced loser who can't get a date with a woman or a man, and so spends his time in front of his computer screen making alliances with other awkward socially malnourished dweebs who  can think of nothing better than to try an interact only thorugh the computer. You do a disservice to all computer geeks everywhere by trying to be more intelligent than others, because the lack of your vision seeps through the anger you display for all to see. Any true hacker knows that the way you have taking stands here has opened you up for retribution, as I am nnot a hacker, I won't work on such matters, in negative aspects. But you should be mindful that you've made a strong mess here, and no matter what your own opinon is, oyu should learn manners, and go out andd get a date rather than having your total amount of human interaction fed to you through wikipedia and your own websites.

In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in \"\"chat-rooms\"\" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment.

You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical \"\"angry\"\" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be. Thank for your tireless efforts. Thank for your senseless, heartless, worthless, and above all tireless efforts. I really do hate you.\"",

Do you think that I'm going to be crazy enough to believe DR is only 11% Black??  I'll be too ashamed of saying such a thing.  I agree on you on that one. 51% mulatto, 46% black, 2% white is the real demographic approximates of DR. Where is the \"\" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??\n   I stated an increase from 11% that somebody else place here from CIA to 46%, that's an increase of 35. So I am the anti-black, racist,denier??? \n\n   I knew that you where going to throw the \"\" Moor myth\"\" about Spaniards, you are showing the radical afrocentric nut. What's next? you also believe in Van Sertima's book, that the Olmec heads of the Yucatan peninsula are Africans? or that snow is really black??\n   DNA studies in Spaniards show that less than 2% have Moor blood. It has been weed out,since the fall of Cordova in 1236, by the \"\" limpieza de sangre\"\" campaign of the christians. Spaniards are White as are the anglo-saxons,and the Irish. I'm not going into deep details about \"\" Moors and Spain\"\" with a radical Afrocentric nut, but going back to the article, we are not going to allow that the DR article is going to get hijack by radical afrocentric nut, nor eurocentric too. As you can see, I'm not eurocentric, 16% white to 2% white, do the math. \n\n    You think that you where going to deal with an ignoramus, but when it comes to history, you are kindergarten compared to me. You say \"\" society\"\" says that such words are offensive? wow, impresive answer. you are a clown. You still don't own Wikipedia and the English language, and you don't speak for \"\" society\"\", \"\" society\"\" has diverse views of the world. The article will be changed. platanogenius\"",
