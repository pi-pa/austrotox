That's all I've ever wanted and I think an investigation of the history of that and related articles and talk pages will show my behavior to have been exemplary.  I will admit, however, that the real reason I don't edit the article isn't because of what JW said that day (please also see his comment on the NXIVM talk page), but rather because they know where I live, if you know what I mean, and it's just a few miles from him and it, and that I'm just another nobody in particular who spends way too much of his life on Wikipedia; whereas they are mind-bogglingly rich, connected, and powerful people. \n\n :::Again, please ignore all of that.

Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.\n\nIf you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said \"\"What language is that?\"\" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.\n\nYour other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between \"\"nigga\"\" and \"\"nigger\"\", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a \"\"black person\"\". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying \"\"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.\"\"?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word \"\"nigger\"\" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word \"\"nigger\"\".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.\n\nI forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to \"\"Winston Churchill\"\".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.

        "Comment": "\"\n\nIf you think that Vaishnavas are born and die - than you are not to be delivered for millions of kalpas:\n\nI am sorry, but this is fact:\n\"\"Anyone who does not float in this inundation is most condemned. Such a person cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas.\nPURPORT\nThe kalpa is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ. One day of Brahmā is called a kalpa. A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.\"\"\n\nHowever, you are lucky:\nQ.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?\n\n \n\nA.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:\n\n \n\n(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.\n\n(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.\n\n(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.\n\n \n\nThen Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.\n\n          \n\nSo it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam\n\n        \n\nAlso Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, \"\"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time.\"\" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.\n\n \n\nQ.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?\n\n \n\nA.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.\n\n \n\nQ.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?\n\n \n\nA.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam. For example, translation into Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc. is very eas",

Your comments to me about the \"\"veracity\"\" and the \"\"worthiness\"\" of my edit to the article on the Oregon Vortex were nothing short of rude.  Have you been there?  Do you believe an eye witness is less reliable than someone with a Ph.D., or less who has NEVER been there?  Someone who has never been in the energy and has had the oppotunity to experience all the things that the article derides?  That \"\"optical illusion\"\" that occurs with two people does not happen in a controlled environment.  It takes place in the great outdoors.  And I have also seen the golf balls, and many, many other things.  I now see that Wikipedia is nothing more than a forum for frustrated editors and writers who have never sold anything worthwhile and this is their last claim to fame, and they're going to go for it for all it's worth, regardless of whether they distort the truth or not.  Getting your name out there is what's MOST important.  What arrogance!!!  You don't even live in the US, let alone Oregon!

        "Comment_marked": "\"\n\n Oregon Vortex \n\n Hello Queen Cake!  Your comments to me about the \"\"veracity\"\" and the \"\"worthiness\"\" of my edit to the article on the Oregon Vortex were nothing short of rude.  Have you been there?  Do you believe an eye witness is less reliable than someone with a Ph.D., or less who has NEVER been there?  Someone who has never been in the energy and has had the oppotunity to experience all the things that the article derides?  That \"\"optical illusion\"\" that occurs with two people does not happen in a controlled environment.  It takes place in the great outdoors.  And I have also seen the golf balls, and many, many other things.  I now see that Wikipedia is nothing more than a forum for frustrated editors and writers who have never sold anything worthwhile and this is their last claim to fame, and they're going to go for it for all it's worth, regardless of whether they distort the truth or not.  Getting your name out there is what's MOST important.  What arrogance!!!  You don't even live in the US, let alone Oregon!  I have been to the vortex many, many times, and I will swear on a warehouse of Bibles that all the phenomena is just that:  PHENOMENA.  And by the way, my \"\"name\"\" on this joke of a enclyclopedia is Ms Medium.
