This information in no way detracts from this article and otherwise, the opening is simply a list of trivial details. At the very least, the opening paragraph of this article should state that the Jacksonville metro pop. (yes, METRO, not city) is ranked 42nd in the U.S. as of 2005, but adding that it is 4th in Florda does not hurt. I would add this accurate and scientific info myself, but I seem to be prevented from doing so, which I believe is totally against the spirit of Wikipedia.",

Also, he states that Robb Flynn, Matt Heafy and Phil Anselmo have influences his vocal style. Obie cites Oliver Palotai of Kamelot as a favorite keyboardist. As influences on his vocal style he mentions Brandon Boyd of Incubus and Roy Khan of Kamelot. Rob cites Robert Trujillo of Metallica as an influence and Cioky names John Dolmayan of SOAD as a favorite drummer. Sethgar has named Daron Malakian, also of SOAD as a favorite guitarist.\nThe band plays a blend of multiple genres of metal: metalcore, thrash metal, gothic metal, industrial metal and death metal, but they don't always put all the styles into a single song. They rather blend two or three of these styles into one song, making it difficult for their songs to be catalogued as a specific genre. \n\nBand members\n Psycho - Lead and Rythm guitars, growled vocals, rarely clean vocals \n Obie – Keyboards, clean vocals\n Sethgar – Acoustic Guitars\n Rob – Bass \n Cioky – Drums \n\nFormer members\n Stinkman - Bass \n Maq - Rythm guitar\n G-Orgy - Drums\n Legolas - Drums\n\nDiscography\n HORRORfying (2009 - single)\n Acheron (2009 - Not yet released)\n\n WIKIPEDIA SUCKS!!

Firstly, he has no variation to his moveset, and aas the ECW crowd rightly said at One Night StandSAME OLD SHIT! Its not like the moves he has are even good, for hi to continue using them. Although Cena is a good entertainer, quite frankly he is the worst wrestler I have seen in my life, and as for him having a World Title reignI think it is absolutely preposterous. He shouldn't even be in the WWEOVW should suit his mediocre, half baked, sloppy wrestling style better. ( )",

She never collected Anything. It was Edythe Shepard of Tucson, Arizona who collected a large part of the pieces in the museum and donated them to Rin tin tin.\n\nThere are other issues with other pages such as the Lassie page - you apparently did not follow the \"\"conflict\"\" rules with them (Carol, Joan and Chelsea - yes they are friends of ours and in fact have one of our dogs)and allowed their \"\"version\"\" of facts that surrounded the events associated with Weatherwax. Yet you will not make corrections to things in the Rin Tin Tin article that are incorrect and that are not as self-serving as the statements in the Lassie article. Honestly it appears that you do maintain a double standard.\n\nI now see that you have arbitrarily added that a dog name Rin Tin Tin Smith attended the American Humane hero Dog Award Show in 2011 - there is no dog registered as Rin tin tin Smith and there has never been a dog called Rin Tin tin Smith. Not sure where you got your information but that too is incorrect. The call name of the dog is indeed \"\"Smith\"\" but that is not his registered name. He is Rin Tin tin XII. We would still like to know who gave you this bogus information and it should be corrected. \n\nAnd again regarding Finding Rin Tin tin - if you have Tierney on one page should he not also be on the Finding Rin tin tin page and shouldn't you put Danny Lerner on the Rin Tin tin page.? I am sure Danny Lerner would appreciate that. If you would like a copy of the contract between First Look and Tierney we can certainly provide that to you. It specifically outlines Tierney's involvement as being only limited to a \"\"mention.\"\" He had no direct involvment in the \"\"making\"\" of the film.\n\nI would hope that you would research further to substantiate the 48 puppy issue. Your argument is that because someone \"\"mentions\"\" it is a book that it is absolutely true. If that is the case then why do you discount other authors, books and writings?  You defend Orlean's writings as though they were your own and discount anyone else's, including English. That is surely a double standard and certainly NOT professional in any manner.\n\nWe would hope that your goal would be to provide correct information to people and to do it in a consistent manner. Apparently that is not your goal as evidenced by your self righteous indignation. In a lawsuit you could be described as having unclean hands. Shame on you.\n  \n\n\"",

You really are a hero, and I wish all of us could be a bit more like you! Continue this subconscious feeling of superiority to other people and eagarness to show off, it's great. You're abusive to everything that Scientology is about. It's about learning things for your own and adapting them into your own and using it as a tool for yourself, not becoming what you learn and getting further away from yourself, so you come off quite ridiculous without even realizing it. Oh yeah and all the lies about Scientology on wikipedia don't even really matter,if someone is going to get into Scientology, they're not going to be thrownoff by an encyclopedia that is known for being inaccurate because its written by anyone with a computer, and you take it so seriously like it's really going to affect things and this is  some warzone we need to fight, it's not going to stop scientology so don't worry about it",
