If you want to debate what is and isn't worthy of a goddamned encylopedic entry, then I'm sure you're better off arguing with a wall. Shame on you for censoring and removing content of a TALK-PAGE ARTICLE COMMENT. Thankfully you can't edit or destroy the page-history, so people can see just exactly what you removed and how simple you are. For fucks sake, SNS is not a reliable source, and any news outlet that believes so intentionally delves into bad journalistic endeavors. The article is being removed, deal with it dude. Grow up and acknowledge certain facts, and I'm going to end the conversation at that because I've already spent enough time trying to use the simplest of English sentences to outline and debate this idea with full clarity, yet you still can't understand. You want a BLP violation? You've got autism you cold retarded fuck. (By the way, if you don't think a picture of an asian man along with the author's name being \"\"Gil Asakawa\"\" would certainly clarify that the author is indeed Asian, you're simply completely wrong in likely every regard of life itself that requires any sense of observation skills  71.94.7.228  \"",

Let me clefify some things 4 you,\n\nIn the 19th century Ilija Garasanin and the rest of the Serb goverment of that time formed a program called \"\"Nacertanije\"\", it was a plan of how to realize the plan of a Great Serbia  on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. This new state would be rulled by Serbs, others would be subjected while Muslims(of any ethnicity) would be distroyed(by genocide sense it´s the only way). They called there Army chetnik, them selfs chetniks and there by this ideology(which is fashist) is chetnik. And any1 who follows it is a chetnik.\n\nThe plan failed untill 1918 when the Serbs managed to create a \"\"Slavic Kingdom\"\" which was actually ment to become a Serb Kingdom which was with time shown, during WWII the chetniks allied with the Nazis and commited GENOCIDE. After the death of Tito the chetniks ressurected and tried everyting all over again but ones again failed thank God.\n\nNow, the chetnik PROPAGANDA is used to make Serbs think that it is right to do all that and to foole everybothy else, this propaganda includes showing Bosnia as a \"\"Serb state\"\", Bosniaks as  \"\"Serbs\"\", spreding Islamophobia and Anti-Bosniak settlment or presenting the Serbs as the victoms and so on. THAT site does all that and it is enough to open it and you will see. Now you ain´t nobody so I don´t have to proove anything if you don´t see it then you are either stupid or a chetnik your self.\n 15:59, 29\"",

Your comments to me about the \"\"veracity\"\" and the \"\"worthiness\"\" of my edit to the article on the Oregon Vortex were nothing short of rude.  Have you been there?  Do you believe an eye witness is less reliable than someone with a Ph.D., or less who has NEVER been there?  Someone who has never been in the energy and has had the oppotunity to experience all the things that the article derides?  That \"\"optical illusion\"\" that occurs with two people does not happen in a controlled environment.  It takes place in the great outdoors.  And I have also seen the golf balls, and many, many other things.  I now see that Wikipedia is nothing more than a forum for frustrated editors and writers who have never sold anything worthwhile and this is their last claim to fame, and they're going to go for it for all it's worth, regardless of whether they distort the truth or not.  Getting your name out there is what's MOST important.  What arrogance!!!  You don't even live in the US, let alone Oregon!  I have been to the vortex many, many times, and I will swear on a warehouse of Bibles that all the phenomena is just that:  PHENOMENA.  And by the way, my \"\"name\"\" on this joke of a enclyclopedia is Ms Medium.  That's because I AM a Spiritualist Medium and am sensistive to energies, both good and bad, and I can tell you, yours needs a vigorous cleaning.  MsMedium\"",

If there would be more about Lisi the person, then it should be added here; but the new article appears more to be about the general realm of the theory, and therefore would not belong here.

Look for the book: \"\"Pleistocene Mammals of North America\"\" By Björn Kurtén and Elaine Anderson, just for starters. Now that will require that you read something other than a webpage (actually, you can read part of it online even). There are many sources on Equine evolution and taxonomy. I'm not, however, going to hand them over to you on a silver platter while you feel unristricted in espousing your own ENTIRELY unverifiable claims. Here's a suggestion: read something that isn't written by people lobbying for feral horse protection. You'll get a lot more truthful information out of it. I also don't think it was you that reverted my edit of the Mustang article (not that it needed to be, there are millions of you thoroughly ignorant goons), I was actually looking up sources when I came back and saw it had already been changed and thought; \"\"Jesus, what's the point?\"\" And, once again, you've clearly demonstrated that while you're not at all concerned with accuracy, you still feel you have a right to comment on issues you know next to nothing about. People like YOU, who don't care at all about the accuracy should be banned from editing anything. God Bless the Internet! Oh bringer of Ignorantism!\"",

When the living person has himself admitted committing blasphemy, it can be well understood that the blasphemy has taken place and it is a fact, not an allegation. Even if it is an allegation, the mere title \"\"Blasphemy\"\" doesn't amount to the conviction of blasphemy, if it were so, the title would be \"\"the conviction of blasphemy\"\", hence mere the title \"\"Blasphemy\"\" will not lend any dent onto the neutrality in question. Further, the words saying that he apologized for it, however emotionally, doesn't absolve him of the fact that he committed the blasphemy (which he himself admitted) and hence the same shall be removed, because they suggest favorable inclination to the living person.   \"",

I am an electrical engineer, took a rather meaty course in \"\"Electromagnetic Machinery\"\" using the Fitzgerald/Kingsley/et al text that is used to back up a few of the claims in the article, etc.  Having said that, much of the article, as is, is not so unambiguously clear to the typical Wikipedia reader that such a reader should believe the claims without sources.  There are numerous parts of the article that seem to make extremely specific, and often broad claims, all without any source whatsoever. \n\n :I see no reason at all that this article should get a pass from the rather ordinary parts of WP:V, which is after all, core Wikipedia policy, and includes the idea that challenged material should be either sourced, or it could reasonably be removed, after some period of time.  Moreover, the burden of presenting evidence for the claims is on the editor who wants the material to remain in Wikipedia.  If the material is challenged, and then not sourced by someone who cares enough to do so within a few weeks or a couple of months, then the material may reasonably be removed until such time as sources are found and the material is cited.  This doesn't seem that hard.  Cheers.    \"",

But you will agree that we are all humans, on the internet. I was pointing out the absurdity of that statement. And Adam, if I were trolling you, I would be stupid in the field of the Crusades, which I am not. I have no desire to piss you off. If I am insulting you, please let your rage out on my user talk page. Silverwhistle, I couldn't care less how much you like Conrad, but you have no need to defend him. I still think he was a jerk. Besides, if he never came to Tyre, Saladin would have spared the population and probably 100 years of bloodshed, and perhaps the gay crusade, would never have taken place. Perhaps a thousand years of bloodshed would never have taken place. It was unfortunate that Guy of Lusignan was weak enough to listen to Reynald, but Conrad's interference only intensified the conflict. I suggest we get back on the topic of Humphrey and how we can better this article. Again, please take this to my user page if you truly hate my guts.",

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! \nHow long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?\nWith a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. \nI have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. \nI have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?\nHa ha ha ha ha!\nSee how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!\nAnd that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!\nAnd now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! \nTears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!\nDANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!\nHow glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! \nNO! \nBuddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?\nThen, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! \nAiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...\n\nTHE END",

Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most \ncertainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in \"\"chat-rooms\"\" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical \"\"angry\"\" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be. Thank for your tireless efforts. Thank for your senseless, heartless, worthless, and above all tireless efforts. I really do hate you.\"",

Wikipedia even refers to the Kurdish language as language(s)which does not even make any sense. I am a Kurd myself, I know what I am talking about. Please give me at least 2 reliable sources that refers to the Kurdish language as language(s). The facts I wrote about the Kurdish language can even by seen on Wikipedia. I have information. I have studied. You act as if I am just using information I got out of nowhere. When in fact, it is those people that you allow to change information, which create these problems. You did not even allow anybody to look at my proposal before you jumped in, I posted this proposal only a few hours ago.",

Firstly, he has no variation to his moveset, and aas the ECW crowd rightly said at One Night StandSAME OLD SHIT! Its not like the moves he has are even good, for hi to continue using them. Although Cena is a good entertainer, quite frankly he is the worst wrestler I have seen in my life, and as for him having a World Title reignI think it is absolutely preposterous. He shouldn't even be in the WWEOVW should suit his mediocre, half baked, sloppy wrestling style better. ( )",
