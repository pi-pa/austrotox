        "Comment": "\" \n\n == How about Personal Behavior? == \n\n I agree with you Enigmatical, and I am frustrated by this definition of a word I thought I understood quite well.  When you say one thing, but do another, AND justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is hypocrisy.  But I guess I'm wrong.  Apparently we can never know what someone Actualy believes or feels, because they may be Lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs.  Therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their Actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrites.  This is making my head spin, and hurt alot.   \n\n I really think we need a WORD to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or whatever.  Putting it under \"\"double standard\"\" is not putting a WORD to it.  For instance, say I'm playing an online game, and I meet someone who Kills me, and claims they hate it when people Kill others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been killed by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players.  I am a victim of a victim.  Is this an example of hypocrisy?  Or is it an example of \"\"double standard\"\"?  If it is a \"\"double standard\"\" being applied by the one who killed me, what words do I use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior?  \"\"You are a Hypocrite!\"\" apparently does not apply, so, do I say \"\"You are applying a Double Standard!\"\"?  Somehow it just doesn't have the same Punch.   \n\n To me \"\"Double Standard\"\" relates only to how one decides how different groups should be treated based on their behavior.  If a man commits murder, and whether he is found guilty or not depends solely on the color of his skin, that is a Double Standard, aka Racism.  The differences between how Women and Men are treated in the work place, or by employers, is another example.  A woman can get maternity leave to take care of a new baby, but a man cannot.  I detect a Double Standard there as well. \n\n If I constantly and publicly state that I am against circumcision in all cases, and then have my own child circumcised, am I a hypocrite?  If I am totaly against abortion, but force my daughter to have an abortion, am I a hypocrite?  Have I actualy stated my real beliefs, or was I lieing?  Was my behavior based on my REAL beliefs, and my stated beliefs were lies?  My head hurts too much to keep going. \n\n This is all My Humble Opinion, and I am probably quite stupid and an idiot.\"",

We insulted him, offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant. BLOCK those Mother Fukkers!!! Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those \"\"Indians\"\". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please. We need more from college students who have been indoctrinated in the Church of Academia. That piece by Stitler is one of the most exaggerated and opinionated and so yeah, use that as the title of the page! And by all means give John MAJOR Jenkins his own section. Not a single scholar or Mayanist agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about. We can get away with it, by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind. Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets, so let us know how many you want. FREE popcorn, too! Whoopee! Best wishes from Jimini Cricket 97.123.26.228  \"",

By the late 1800s, capoeira became a word for street brawling. Thus, authorities did not prohibit or sanction \"\"practice\"\" of capoeira. In banning capoeira they were banning outright street brawls! It's why Mestre Bimba presented his art as Luta Regional Baiana. No decent carioca would be eager to sympathise with capoeira and malandrismo. I could attempt to alter the article but it's become such a mess by now.   \"",

Also, if you want to be so documented, this is documentations. In addition, those are FACTS that he is, if to use better words: fabricating lies, twisting truths, throwing slander, sueing on left and right people who disagree with him, calling people deregatory names and comparing them to hitler and to be simple and honest: being a complete retarded jackass. Suck it down and face the truth, or vaporize the page entirely. You know, I start to doubt your motives. Maybe you are Jack's biased crones. Maybe you are jack himself. It would fit his style to do this. Oh and if someone jump with the IP excuse and I have to explain newbies WTF is a proxy one more time...I'll sue you under extreme retardation and claim you should be banned from the Internet as that you obviously not smart enough to be allowed unsupervisied access to it and your presence is harmful. You know what, forget it. I AM going to start protesting for his removal. The less records of this baboon on the internet the better, he doesn't deserve it. He's not Hitler, he's not a mob boss. He's just a low life, wannabe-evil in the simplest form, there's nothing unique about him. It's better to invest these bytes for activists trying to save the ocean layer or something that's actually important and consequential to our and our kid's future than a failed lawyer gone berzerk on the most stupid things ever.

I'm even against the CIA sources that some people wanted to place on the article here, the one about 73% mulatto,16% white and 11% black.  Do you think that I'm going to be crazy enough to believe DR is only 11% Black??  I'll be too ashamed of saying such a thing.  I agree on you on that one. 51% mulatto, 46% black, 2% white is the real demographic approximates of DR. Where is the \"\" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??\n   I stated an increase from 11% that somebody else place here from CIA to 46%, that's an increase of 35. So I am the anti-black, racist,denier??? \n\n   I knew that you where going to throw the \"\" Moor myth\"\" about Spaniards, you are showing the radical afrocentric nut. What's next? you also believe in Van Sertima's book, that the Olmec heads of the Yucatan peninsula are Africans? or that snow is really black??\n   DNA studies in Spaniards show that less than 2% have Moor blood. It has been weed out,since the fall of Cordova in 1236, by the \"\" limpieza de sangre\"\" campaign of the christians. Spaniards are White as are the anglo-saxons,and the Irish. I'm not going into deep details about \"\" Moors and Spain\"\" with a radical Afrocentric nut, but going back to the article, we are not going to allow that the DR article is going to get hijack by radical afrocentric nut, nor eurocentric too. As you can see, I'm not eurocentric, 16% white to 2% white, do the math. \n\n    You think that you where going to deal with an ignoramus, but when it comes to history, you are kindergarten compared to me. You say \"\" society\"\" says that such words are offensive? wow, impresive answer. you are a clown. You still don't own Wikipedia and the English language, and you don't speak for \"\" society\"\", \"\" society\"\" has diverse views of the world. The article will be changed. platanogenius\"",

He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.\n\nTo that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure.",

That is why Obama would rather have all America know that he is a incompetent scumbag then  know the truth.  OK go ahead and delete this truth since Wakopedia is all about lies and coverup.

I modified that, everybody knows that that's Moldovans and Romanians are the same shit, anyhow the census will say it. They speak Romanian, and not Moldovan how they sustain. A Romanian understands perfectly when a Moldovan is speaking it's fuckin' language called Moldovan, and vice versa. Moldovans are doing this because they are a gang of betrayers and retarded that don't have idea what's their ancestry. Let's be reasonable now, even if I think that you people here are too stupid to understand this. They were Romanians until 1940, and suddenly they changed of ethnicity because they are an different country than Romania.   ' 10 June 2006",

        "Comment": "\" \n\n == Is Ciliopathy  as a genetypic cause of phenotypical obesity  worth mentioning in the article? == \n\n A few edits ago, I added a single sentence to the obesity article:  \"\"Obesity is one symptom reported in a newly discovered class of genetic diseases known as ciliopathies\"\" which I sourced from this journal article:    My edit was removed, perhaps because I wrote poorly. \n\n What I was trying to say is that there is now, as of some fairly recent developments in the genetics literature, at least a plausible hypothesis that one potential cause (underlying molecular cause, or underlying genetic cause) for some particular cases of clinically observed obesities is ciliopathy.  Perhaps my use of the word \"\"symptom\"\" was a mistake; but I thought that saying \"\"one potential genotype for the obesity phenotype is ciliopathy\"\" to be rather too esoteric.  Perhaps the entire sentence needs to be rewritten.  But I do think it is an appropriate addition to the Obesity article. \n\n I am in no way saying that all ciliopathies result in obesity.  They obviously do not.  From the last ten years of work in molecular genetics with animals that have the cilia organelle, one thing that is obvious is that ciliopathies manifest in an extremely pleiotropic manner.  But there is a plausible hypothesis that has been put forward in the academic literature relating to a ciliopathic underlying cause for some clinically observed obesities; it has to do with a dysfunction in the molecular signaling pathway (along the cilia and/or basal bodies) that signals fullness, and/or taste, and/or time to move food onward in the large and/or small bowell, etc.  To date, most of the specific ciliopathic genes that have been related to obesity have been studied only in relation to more pleiotropic genetic syndromes such as Alstrom's, MKKS and BBS.  But the ciliopathic root cause, identified in some and implied in others, is encyclopedically interesting. \n\n In my view, this newly-discovered connection is worthy of mention in the obesity article.  But I am not well-read on Obesity, so I will let those editors who frequent this article hash it out.  Cheers.   \"",

I am taking a bit of a stab, but I think it the safer option, unless someone has a more specific timeline for this shifting term. I removed the adjective fantastic as it has duel meaning, and as I don't think the reviewer meant that the work was wonderful or excellent, but absurd, strange, and eccentric, but I'm not sure what single word to add that doesn't imply criticism - .

        "Comment": "Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 \nA math-wiki:\n\nYou are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... \n\nNow let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:\n\nA)    1=3(1/3)\nB)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)\nC)    3(0.333...) =0.999... \n\nThe problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. \n0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any\nradix system.\n\nYou mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r\nsuch that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then \nwhat are the integers q and r such that the above is true?\n\nSuppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.\nFor example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the\ndivision algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.\n\nNow suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:\n\n1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!\n\nI want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site. You are a bunch of retarded, conceited fools who I look upon with the utmost hatred and condemnation. Your site is absolute crap because it is run by fools like Michael\nHardy, Kmrsq, Melchoir, Meni (idiot) Rosenfeld, et al. DIE WIKIPEDIA!!!! HAIL KNOLL!!!! 98.195.24.26",

Neither of them are anywhere close to newbies and they really should know better than to edit war over a single word whose existence or lack thereof has no meaning to the vast majority of English readers. It's just plain ridiculous that we have to look at that kind of nonsense over a glaring WP:ARBMAC hot-button issue. If anything, I could have made IvanOS' block a longer one, because I've previously applied blocks to them with no apparent result. YMMV; I see you're an admin, so you can adjust block lengths yourself.",
