First those special space gloves never existed and second this is the first time I hear anything about such thing! IF YOU WANT TO TALK SH** ADD SOME SOURCES FIRST! I am sick of anti- Croatian propaganda! \nAdd the links of the pictures (if they exist) into the discussion. If they are not uploaded, upload them (outside wikipedia) and post a link in here. Admins and moderators will decide if those pictures are too terrible to publish or not....but of course those pictures are from you GreaterSerbian imagination, aren't they.\nExplain to me why all teh sources published here were judged unreliable? Because there aren't any reliable sources! The sources I see now are laughable and they are not proving anything! In fact, I am suprised that this article is still standing.\nYes, maybe I have complexes (Serbs like that word). \nFact is, I do not hate normal Serbs, I hate only xenophobic Serbs spreading lies. And Wikipedia is full of them. \nOh yeah, I forgot! YOU aren't Serbs,you are from UK or USA! You have Serbian IP's only to deceive racist people ;)))) (sarcasm)\nCroat with complexes logging out.",

A page was being utilized as a user page simply to figure out the structure of Wikipedia, to learn the coding of  Wikipedia, and to experiment with.  Some text was simply cut and pasted onto a page, per Wiki guidelines, nothign was submitted as an article, because the test area was to be kept to a user area.  This is what we were doing.  Using the user name as a testing area PER WIKI GUIDLINES.  No article would have been submitted until such time as it met Wiki guidelines, but you you deleted the page before that could take place.  Are you really this obtuse?  In all seriousness, testing are refining articles in user pages is encouraged by Wikipedia.  This is what we were doing.  In our opinion, you are not familiar enough with Wiki guidelines to exercise any control over the deletion of articles.  It is the afternoon.  Elementary school should be getting out soon.  There should be some 9 year old that you can go outside and shove around.  I regret that you have little authority over your real life, but I don't think the intent of Wiki was for you to vent that frustration and lack of control in meatspace over the entirety of the Encyclopedia.  Thank's for deleting the demo template, you complete and utter fuckwit.  Next time we'll just throw something into the public domain and give you something to actually do other than mentally masturbate.    \"",

You can check Meijer, the Cambridge history, Casson or Morrison and Coates. In all of them, the warships of the 4th to 1st centuries BC are handled together, whether they were of Punic or Greek type, which is quite natural, as explained above. For the Hellenistic , I agree it is not very accurate, but Morrison at least has written a chapter \"\"Hellenistic Oared Warships, 399–31 BC\"\" in AGE OF THE GALLEY in which he includes both Western and Eastern Mediterranean ships. Perhaps a more accurate title for our article would be \"\"Hellenistic-era warships\"\" which emphasizes the period and not the culture? Given that the Hellenistic era lasted all the way to the battle of Actium, it would also fit the article's scope.    ✍  \"",

And I don't care what that long haired, anti-punk hippie Cobain was quoted as saying. You're going to depend your grunge history and contradict punk's with only ONE quote? And from a hippie who was part of a movement that helped bring punk down? That makes NO sense. I'm going to provide plenty a quote when the time comes that will vastly overshadow the quotes you have. And you godamn better not re-edit or I'll have you banned! I've done it before and I'll do it again!\n\nBy the way, I'm damn happy that idiot Cobain died. He did nothing for punk but bury it using stupid american grunge music. You lame americans don't know anything about and have no taste for style, fashion, or music.",

I'm not making this an edit war to keep Louisville there  but with so many sources saying 'Louisville', it would be irresponsible for me to drop this.  Talk • Work \n\n\"",

Unless its revealed that he has special implants or something to link him to the suit, I don't he and the suit could be considered one and the same, which is the definition of Cyborg.

I see another, white editor has weighed in and supported the inclusion of the photograph of the white woman.  What?  You gonna call him \"\"racist scum,\"\" too?

Your reward is that all your time spent here will be to no avail when it all gets 'speed deleted' and 'reverted' with the same air of arrogance as you have demonstrated here.

We insulted him, offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant. BLOCK those Mother Fukkers!!! Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those \"\"Indians\"\". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please. We need more from college students who have been indoctrinated in the Church of Academia. That piece by Stitler is one of the most exaggerated and opinionated and so yeah, use that as the title of the page! And by all means give John MAJOR Jenkins his own section. Not a single scholar or Mayanists agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about. We can get away with it, by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind. Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets, so let us know how many you want. FREE popcorn, too! Whoopee! Best wishes from Jimini Cricket 97.123.26.228  \"",

And as far as that sort of pathetic wikipolitics goes, that's at least one thing they do seem to have a learning capacity for. Just look at how many new words and phrases they've learned in that regard, just from that one ANI, which will no doubt come in handy the next time they fuck up and delete something for being a BLP violation when it isn't, or asking for signs of notability for in-article content, or any of the other stupid things he does, and repeats because he just won't be told, because he's an incompetent. I'm sure the project will flourish if it self-selects editors who only have that skill, while kicking out the ones who do know their arses from their elbows, and can actually write content without making a fucking balls up of it at step 1.",

What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.",

My suggestion is to clarify the issue, by making the appropriate edits to the article, and cite the reasons by supplying the page number of the particular edition of \"\"Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley\"\", so as to provide a proof to other editors who may dispute your revision. Also, if you could add the reasoning for your changes to the article talk page, dialogue can be established between editors with differing information. I believe \"\"The Autobiography...\"\" is a well established resource for information regarding the minister. If you will, please sign your posts to talk and discussion pages with four \"\"~\"\" marks. This will auto-sign and date your posts, for easier use of other editors.

You violate the rules by blocking me then claim I violated the \"\"spirit of the rule.\"\"  Your violation is \"\"debatable\"\" like the Occupied Territories are \"\"disputed.\"\" You are just abusing your authority to push your petty authoritarian agenda that obviously reflects your personal insecurities. You think you can threaten and bully me.  \"\"And I guess you won't be reverting so quickly in future, will you now?\"\" What a weasel. Please go ahead and contribute your petty complaints to ban me so I don't bother wasting my time on a project populated by immature arrogant twerps, fascist Zionist bigots, Islamophobe hate-mongers, bunch of lameass bigots and losers. Why waste my time?   07:48, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)\"",

Everyone reading it going to see right away that the critics (who like idiotic garage bands that only know three chords) must be wrong. At the same time, it is important that this page does not read too much like a fan page. That is why that portion of the sentence is there. Feel free to make it sound less harsh though. \n\n\"",

If both are still in use and not private airstrips, I think each could have its own article.",

I think it's fair to say that most decay rates can be reproduced by theory to within an order of magnitude or thereabouts. All but the lightest nuclei represent extremely complex many-body problems that cannot be solved exactly (not at the moment anyway). You can make general comments, like for a particular isotope (i.e. constant proton number) the beta decay half-life gradually shortens as you move away from the line of stability (increasing or decreasing the number of neutrons).",

The argument that even though the particles change instantaneously upon measurement but cannot be realized FTL - I find entirely misleading, as the actual change does take place FTL - and most reasonable people look at the problem of communication as the actual change between two distant objects, not how fast the change is actually ascertained (it would be like saying the speed of electricity isn't actually what it is because the brain cannot deduce information passed to it as fast as the electricity - which in my opinion is entirely misleading.)\n\nTwo recent articles on non-locality that show FTL transference of information:\n- Francis, Matthew. Quantum entanglement shows that reality can't be local, Ars Technica, 30 October 2012\n- Juan, Yin Bounding the speed of `spooky action at a distance' URLTOK\n\nI would like other opinions on this - and I am wondering if the statement above might be qualified, at least so it doesn't appear to the layman that there is absolutely no debate on the subject or that the conclusion presented here is unchallenged.",

Looks like the two of them are on here basahing other people until they stand alone as edit king. Too bad someone else wrote about Rose's own anti semiticism, and racism. Poor Sojambi has been trying to fix it ever since. The sad thing is, he is so one sided, he has a difficult time persuading others of his NPOV- therefore he lashes out, and you were caught up in the crossfire(evidence here[]) Notice, he's only comparing what he wants you to see. the connection? well there isn't any really, but by creative use of wiki skills he tries to cover his own manipulations by using hanging you up as the villain. It's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. By accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user. It's also reminiscent of those toubling Republican smear tactics of last year- only translated to this site. He's a schmuck. Claims to be latino, then claims to be jewish, then claims to be black, then claims to be white. Next he'll claim to be a woman. He's already claimed to be a few other people, and it was his vandalism of other peoples talk page and of the Rose page itself that got it frozen in the first place. Also of note is his complete inability to sleuth. I would find his \"\"detective\"\" skills humorous if they weren't so evil. good luck, and I bet your singing voice would improve, if only you would practice. \"",

Suppose that there were links to Talk:Second city (with a lowercase c) on various pages across the wiki.  When Talk:Second city gets moved to Talk:List of second cities, it is usually a good idea to redirect the old talkpage so that those links will go to the right place.  If the talk page were simply left blank, people clicking onto it would be confused.  There don't seem to be any such links currently however, so that rationale doesn't really apply.  I don't really have a firm opinion on this.  I at first redirected it to talk:Second City, but you're right that people would only go to talk:Second city if they had deliberately avoided following the redirect.    Talk/Contributions",

Accordingly, there's no clear demonstration that this is a notable web service. IMO, there's enough of an assertion that the article should not be deleted under speedy deletion criterion A7; however, it could easily be sent for deletion discussion.\nReliable sourcing: Other than basekit's website, the only source provided is a review at Download Squad. It appears to be on par with Engadget in terms of reliability. Still, to build a robust article (and demonstrate general notability), citations to other independent reliable sources should be made.\nMy personal recommendation is that this article be given some time to incubate, but if it's not improved over the next few weeks, it is subject to being nominated for deletion. —'''''' (talk)",

The topic I uploaded was of a fictional organisation whose comedy nature DOES appeal to those people blessed with a pulse. Before any of us here could edit/link or expand our article...you deleted it.\n\nIt seems to me you are a lonely, Spurs-supporting, bird loving (and to what extent?), non-humourous, southern fairy cake...who probably smells. And whose big dumb face is as dumb as a butt. We sound childish yes, however, we cannot beleive that there are people as pathetic as you lording yourself around the internet. It was people like you, sir, who were responsible for carrying every major dictator and despot of the last century to power on a wave of apathy, ill-humour and rubber-desk-johnny procedure-bound mentral dross. You are, by any reasonable and objective measure, worse than Stalin. You are the reason this world is full of crashing bores!\n\nPlease do not delete our article again...Or we will 180 the internet. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Mike Deathray (talk • contribs) .",

You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  \n\nI know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. \n\nI will do so now too:\n\nJerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.\n\n==\"",

Suppose that I, a British gentleman and university graduate (and therefore arguably entitled to the style Esq in the UK), but not a qualified lawyer of any sort, were to visit the US and happen to use the suffix Esq there.  Could I be prosecuted for misrepresentation?  Do the state bars claim sole right to grant this suffix in the US, or are they just the only organisations which currently do?  This is entirely a hypothetical question, by the way - I'm not expecting to visit the US in the near future, and I don't write Esq after my name anyway - I'm just curious as to the exact legal standing of the term in the US.",
