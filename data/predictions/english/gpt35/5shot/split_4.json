DilbarJan(/NisarKand) claimed he would helping Taliban but since Beh-Nam is a Persian and the Taliban were looking for cleansing Tajiks who could he be NisarKand self since Dilbar is allready NisarKand!? Plz dear Admins, unblock him. Beh-Nam is for a long time on Wikipedia and he didn´t do sth bad either against any nations nor against any User or any articles. The admins of Wikipedia now banned two or three of Tajiks who were one o the important ones here at least they were the sole Tajiks who were active. Plz Admins, ban DilbarJan who is writing articles from his nationalistic view. With best regards",

        "Comment": "\"\n\nNotes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself\n\nThere seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.\nThere is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. \nCastro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. \nYou could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! \nBut you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. \nYou claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. \n\n\"\"Right\"\"!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! \nIt amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.\nDo not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. \nYou do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  \nYou must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.\nThis is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! \nThat is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, \nhe(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.\n\nAsk yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?\n\nMany people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. \n \nCastro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. \n\nFor you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his \"\"principles\"\". \nJust to refresh old memories Cuba was suppose to be for Cubans at the beginning of the revolution. For a while Now because the commander was afraid of loosing his grip on power he had to",

So I'm trying to change it so Trivium becomes the band article, and the old Trivium becomes Trivium (education) or (medievil education). How would I go about changing all this, I'll also fix all the 'pages that link to this'.   \"",

I have several authors, scholars, and historians standing behind me to refute your claim of your sourced documentation.\n\nVandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia.

His edits are akin to anti-science fundamentalists attempting to take over articles on Darwinism and evolution. \n\n In any case, this certainly needs the attention of a third-party, reliable admin.  \n\n ===Pre-seed=== \n → in re:  and  \n\n Looks like you deleted Pre-Seed and I blocked the original editor for username vios.  Can you take a look at the notes the new user has left on  about wanting to try again.  There are a bunch of different issues (copyvio / OR) that they have introduced through their requests, but in the spirit of growing (rather than limiting) the project I was thinking about giving them another chance as long as they are willing to follow the rules.  Your thoughts?    \n : I'm not inclined to cut much slack for coi spas.  If the product has truly achieved notability, it shouldn't be difficult for uninvolved parties to write an appropriately sourced and encylopedic article about it.  You may get more feedback on the COI noticeboard.  –    \n\n \"",

I love the wikipedia concept, but when you're an example of the typical user, I'm sad to say that I just can't believe in it. That you resorted to every conceivable argument to keep a well-attested fact out of a pop-culture page is just pathetic. Do you care so much about the song that the mere mention of its use in a stupid show like Family Guy requires you to spend hours and hours trying to keep that information off the wikipedia page?\n\nI hope your fingers all fall off so you have to find something better to do than edit wiki pages.",

        "Comment": "\" June 2012 (UTC) \n :::To answer your questions, I must have made a mistake and said 'here\"\" instead of \"\"there\"\".  I'll go back and check. Second, if you search for \"\"NXIVM\"\" in his archives, JW asked me not to edit it as I once called myself a \"\"hater\"\" and he said felt that people who hate people shouldn't be editing articles about them, generally.  I protest, because if you go and see where I said that in context it's very clear that I was using it as a synonym for the opposite of the word \"\"fan\"\", in the context of a discussion on the roles of fans and opposite of fans on Wikipedia; how fans and \"\"haters\"\" are responsible for most of the content on Wikipedia, as they are motivated, and both are biased, but they can still author NPOV articles; and that indifferent people, while maybe ideal authors for articles in order to get it NPOV, are very difficult to motivate to help author articles.  You being a case in point. \n :::Also, I insist that my feelings toward him and it are not nearly as well described by the word \"\"hate\"\" as they are by the words \"\"concern\"\" or even \"\"alarm\"\", emotions I maintain that would happen to any person with normal human emotions who gets familiar with the WP:RSes on the topic, which in my case all stems from simply being a regular reader of the local broadsheet papers in this area.  And also although my feelings might explain why I'm motivated to push for article improvement, it doesn't mean that I want anything but a NPOV WP:\"\"Good\"\" article there, and that it be \"\"done right\"\" as JW says.  That's all I've ever wanted and I think an investigation of the history of that and related articles and talk pages will show my behavior to have been exemplary.  I will admit, however, that the real reason I don't edit the article isn't because of what JW said that day (please also see his comment on the NXIVM talk page), but rather because they know where I live, if you know what I mean, and it's just a few miles from him and it, and that I'm just another nobody in particular who spends way too much of his life on Wikipedia; whereas they are mind-bogglingly rich, connected, and powerful people. \n\n :::Again, please ignore all of that.  All you should know is what you read in Forbes; that is all you should know to edit or comment on the draft slated to enter the mainspace.  Thank you for your recent contributions to the article but as I was trying to tell you, that \"\"Bromfman Insident\"\" section is going to be deleted anyway and replaced with the final draft on the NXIVM discussion page, section \"\"Forbes coverage\"\", subsection \"\"draft\"\".  So therefore there's no point in your editing that section.  And also, have your read the magazine yet?  That's the first step, don't you agree, before anything else?  Tell me what I've got to say to you to get you to simply read this magazine.   \n\n Once again, here it is: \n :The cover: URLTOK \n :Art work that went with the article: URLTOK \n :Article and sidebars about other executive coaching programs: URLTOK  \n :First follow-up: URLTOK  \n :Second follow-up: URLTOK  \n :Draft describing the above, for you to look at with an eye to improvement, only after you have read the above: Talk:NXIVM#Forbes_coverage, subsection Draft.   \n\n The point is to compare the two and get the draft to match the article, and when it's ready to replace the \"\"Bromfman incident\"\" section of the article NXIVM.  That the draft properly describe the article you will have read by they time you look at the draft.  That is all.  Then maybe you should leave it alone and help me find another appropriate editor so the whole thing becomes a product of the hive mind and not them vs. you or me or any other individual, and I will ask no more of you.  My goal is also to entrust it to the community and leave it alone. \n\n Please! And Thank You!   07:41, 16\"",

For the longest time, I thought the whole thing represented very compelling evidenceif not the *most* compelling evidencesupporting Bigfoot's existence, but there actually *is* a cogent \"\"hoax\"\" counter-argument.  Should this be summarized and included?   \"",

I'm sorry, but you're wrong about that, and your efforts at trying to say otherwise are making you look worse by the minute.  You are sacrificing your reputation for what?  When I don't play nice, and I do not play nice with some aspects of the meddling Projects, you start trying to again go with intimidation and majesty.\nThe problem is that you've undercut yourself with errors of fact, mistakes in outlook, enunciation of incompatible goals, and now trying to reach for official power to remedy the situation.  That's hideous, and it marks you are temperamentally incompatible.  You should not behave in that way.  A good administrator knows better than to threaten silly things like \"\"you are insulting me\"\" when they've been in multiple reverts.  In fact, the utter triviality of the stakes involved make you look even worse.  They make you look like a troll.\nThis is simply disgraceful.  Go away, please, and assess other assessings, but the assigninity is simply overwhelming here and now.    \n\"",

Assuming this footnote is a good idea, I've looked around, but it seems a lot of the negative opinions are from people with axes to grind, such as Osho etc. A lot of these opinions I have previously removed when part of the article body for reasons explained, and I definitely do not think they belong there.

Either way, I'm with a different ISP soon, so your block ends right there anyway. You are all way to triggerhappy with your so-called 'fair' judgements on users you have never really checked the backgrounds on. THAT is insulting enough by itself. Especially considering how it started. I never started it. Look it up if you want. (most of you are too lazy to ever really do that) So again: As long as you insult me, either by blocking me unrightfully, I will insult and if necessary annoy you back. 194.109.22.149",
