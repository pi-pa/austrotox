In this case, given that we have an existing official WP:PSTS policy which we don't want confused with any proposed guideline with a similar name, it is imperative that the first few words be as distinct as possible from the policy. Therefore, starting the name with \"\"Handling\"\" helps, since it immediately tells the editor that this is a \"\"How to\"\" type page, vs. a possible core policy or guideline. Again, our goal is to prevent confusion, and the first part of the name is critical. Crum375 (talk)  posted on  \n ::That is a nice theory, and I know SlimVirgin would agree with you on it.  But why is this now deemed to be the consensus that I must argue against.  No one brought up the idea of moving the page from Wikipedia:Primary, secondary and tertiary sources before SlimVirgin renamed it.  Surely some consensus should have been reached for that?    \"",

These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, \nbureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,\nand Vandals are needed to \"\"cull the herd\"\".

It's about YOUR retroactive reversion of a simple edit trying to include secondary independent verification of sedimentary nanodiamonds in Younger Dryas sediments by Bement and Madden et al., WITHOUT DISCUSSION a reference that I notice has NOT YET been included in the reference list still, after all this time. This is after you ADMIT that you are ignorant of the peer review literature and the controversy. Any attempt to do simple reference list edits on this page have been stomped by no less that five admittedly biased and ignorant editors. The honorable thing to do here would be to recuse yourself from editing the page, as I have. But I haven't seen that happening until now. Good luck with it, you've already made complete fools of yourselves.",

        "Comment": "\"\nno seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that \"\"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot\"\".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says \"\"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY\"\" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.\n\nIf you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said \"\"What language is that?\"\" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.\n\nYour other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between \"\"nigga\"\" and \"\"nigger\"\", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a \"\"black person\"\". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying \"\"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.\"\"?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word \"\"nigger\"\" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word \"\"nigger\"\".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.\n\nI forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to \"\"Winston Churchill\"\".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves. IF you ever succeed in getting all sand out of your vaginas.  I joined wikipedia because i wanted to make it better, and that was all i did.  but i guess you cunts actually enjoy bathing aro",

        "Comment": "\" \n\n == \"\"Commonly feigned\"\" section == \n\n Hey, I don't edit wikipedia often so I am sorry if I am doing anything wrong here. But I was just reading this article and I found the section \"\"Illnesses and conditions commonly feigned by Münchausen patients\"\" very offensive. First there's the overlap with psychiatric disorders. If someone repeatedly checks in to the hospital with -big air quotes- DEPRESSION, well, how would saying they are suffering from Münchausen syndrome be any more likely than saying they are suffering from depression? Secondly, there's the fact that the editor himself/herself says \"\"Many of these conditions do not have clearly observable or diagnostic symptoms.\"\" I'm pretty sure the hallmark of Münchausen syndrome is that the symptoms are observable but fake - not that they are characteristic of medically difficult problems. I myself have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (\"\"Myalgic encephalomyelitis\"\" as it's billed here), for which science has thus far failed to find any universal testable diagnostic criteria. Since this can't be measured then, does that mean that everyone with CFS and similar conditions is faking it? Of course not. \n\n In summary I vote that this entire section be removed. If someone knows the rules (it was flagged in Sept 2010, that's quite a while ago) and could facilitate the process, I'd appreciate it. \n\n   \"",

She never collected Anything. It was Edythe Shepard of Tucson, Arizona who collected a large part of the pieces in the museum and donated them to Rin tin tin.\n\nThere are other issues with other pages such as the Lassie page - you apparently did not follow the \"\"conflict\"\" rules with them (Carol, Joan and Chelsea - yes they are friends of ours and in fact have one of our dogs)and allowed their \"\"version\"\" of facts that surrounded the events associated with Weatherwax. Yet you will not make corrections to things in the Rin Tin Tin article that are incorrect and that are not as self-serving as the statements in the Lassie article. Honestly it appears that you do maintain a double standard.\n\nI now see that you have arbitrarily added that a dog name Rin Tin Tin Smith attended the American Humane hero Dog Award Show in 2011 - there is no dog registered as Rin tin tin Smith and there has never been a dog called Rin Tin tin Smith. Not sure where you got your information but that too is incorrect. The call name of the dog is indeed \"\"Smith\"\" but that is not his registered name. He is Rin Tin tin XII. We would still like to know who gave you this bogus information and it should be corrected. \n\nAnd again regarding Finding Rin Tin tin - if you have Tierney on one page should he not also be on the Finding Rin tin tin page and shouldn't you put Danny Lerner on the Rin Tin tin page.? I am sure Danny Lerner would appreciate that. If you would like a copy of the contract between First Look and Tierney we can certainly provide that to you. It specifically outlines Tierney's involvement as being only limited to a \"\"mention.\"\" He had no direct involvment in the \"\"making\"\" of the film.\n\nI would hope that you would research further to substantiate the 48 puppy issue. Your argument is that because someone \"\"mentions\"\" it is a book that it is absolutely true. If that is the case then why do you discount other authors, books and writings?  You defend Orlean's writings as though they were your own and discount anyone else's, including English. That is surely a double standard and certainly NOT professional in any manner.\n\nWe would hope that your goal would be to provide correct information to people and to do it in a consistent manner. Apparently that is not your goal as evidenced by your self righteous indignation. In a lawsuit you could be described as having unclean hands. Shame on you.\n  \n\n\"",

Adding non-controversial facts to BLP articles, such as birthplaces, does not call for reversions.   Please see WP:BITE. Even 30 seconds of your time would confirm that user's edits are legitimate, since World Snooker's own player profiles often contain the very information that the user has been adding. I agree with your note on the user's talk page, to add sources, but deletion of all of the user's contributions is quite extremist. —  [] []  ‹(-¿-)› \"",

What a moron.  \n\nAre you serious?  The wing speed of a hummingbird has NOTHING to do with George Bush!  The fact taht you said that is pure idiocy!  Also, what Bush has for breakfast(remember, we start names with UPPER CASE) has nothing to do with anything.  However, a quote that he made in a public speech with the American people is VERY relevant!   \n\nYou clearly have no brain.  Are you GW's friend or something?",

I believe preferring no one posts incorrect answers is a given, but saying as much implies people provide answers they know are incorrect. The \"\"biased drivel\"\" I was referring to doesn't fall under that category either way. Biased opinions—all opinions, really—are neither incorrect nor correct. I am pointing out that they are irrelevant and have no place in the discussion. You would think that would also be a given, but it happens all too often.
